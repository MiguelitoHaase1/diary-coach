I know I need to prioritize, but there\u2019s always that nagging fear of disappointing stakeholders. It just feels risky, you know?

I suppose it might feel freeing to focus on what truly matters, but the fear of disappointing stakeholders keeps creeping in.

I know it\u2019s about finding that balance, but the thought of saying no still feels like a risk.

I worry that even focusing on one aspect could open a floodgate of requests and make things messier.

We\u2019re already stretched thin, and I worry about the fallout from rejecting requests, even if they\u2019re not aligned with our goals. Communicating that effectively without undermining the team\u2019s efforts is another challenge. I know it\u2019s about prioritization, but it feels like I\u2019m walking a tightrope.

But if I can frame it around our goals and show how it aligns with what we\u2019re trying to achieve, that might help. Maybe if I clarify that we\u2019re prioritizing high-impact features over lower ones, it could make it easier. I\u2019m still not totally comfortable with it, but I can see how it might help us focus our efforts. Just hope it doesn\u2019t backfire."
