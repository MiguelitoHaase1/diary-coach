# Deep Thoughts: Overcoming Perfectionism Paralysis

## Core Problem
You're grappling with perfectionism paralysis - the fear of starting important work unless conditions are "just right." This mental trap is blocking you from making meaningful progress on high-impact projects like improving collaboration processes. The deeper challenge is learning to embrace imperfect action over perfect planning.

## Fact Check
✅ Both organizing your files and analyzing user research feel important 
❓ Waiting for the "right day" will lead to better outcomes on sprint planning
❌ Experimenting with collaboration processes might be a "complete waste"

## Just One More Thing... (Devil's Advocate)
I hear your desire to wait for ideal conditions before tackling sprint planning, but just one more thing puzzles me... What if there's no such thing as the "perfect time" and delaying action is the real risk? Messy progress beats perfect procrastination. 

## Hints (Without Giving Away the Answer)
- What would you attempt today if you knew you couldn't fail?
- Imagine fast-forwarding a year. What small action today would make Future You most grateful?
- How could you reframe "imperfect experiments" as valuable learning opportunities rather than "wastes of time"?

## Evaluation Summary

## Conversation Transcript
```
Michael: I need to pick the most important problem to solve today. I'm torn between organizing my file system to improve focus, or diving into the user research analysis for our next product feature. Both feel important.

Coach: Good morning Michael! If a mysterious genie appeared and said you could only solve ONE of these problems today - but guaranteed total success - which would make the biggest difference to your life and work next week?

Michael: the collaboration process improvement feels right, but I'm worried this might be a waste of time if I don't get it right.

Coach: Ah, there's that perfectionist voice sneaking in! What's the smallest experiment you could run today that would teach you something useful about collaboration - even if it's not perfect?

Michael: I'm leaning toward the sprint planning redesign, but maybe I should wait for a day when I can give it proper attention. I agree I should choose, but I'd rather wait than risk picking something that's a complete waste.

Coach: I notice you're creating a perfect future day that might never come. What's the real fear making you hesitate to start the sprint planning work today, even imperfectly?

Michael: the collaboration process improvement seems like the best option, but what if I invest all this effort in the wrong approach? I know I need to pick something, but I want to make sure I have the right conditions first.

Coach: *Gently* Your brain is working overtime to protect you from potential "waste," but what if messy progress beats perfect planning? What's the smallest way you could test your collaboration ideas today?
