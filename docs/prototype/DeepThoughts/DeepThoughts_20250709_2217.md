# Deep Thoughts: Aligning Multi-Agent Systems with Core Beliefs

## 1. Problem Significance & Stakes
**What was established:** The coach uncovered that creating a multi-agent system that can identify meaningful problems from Michael's todos is deeply connected to his core beliefs. Solving this would allow the system to surface insights that genuinely resonate with who Michael is becoming.

**Missing exploration:** To further clarify the stakes:
- "What specific outcomes in your life/work would change if you had an agent that consistently identified problems aligned with your core beliefs?"
- "How would solving this problem help you live out your beliefs more fully?"

## 2. Today's Concrete Task 
**Task defined:** Create the session 7 markdown describing the approach for the multi-agent system.
- Deliverable: Session 7 markdown document
- Success criteria: Captures the key aspects of having the agent identify meaningful problems based on core beliefs
- Time estimate: Not explicitly stated, but implied to be achievable today

**Task refinement needed:** The task could be further broken down:
1. Outline the key components of the approach to cover
2. Draft the detailed description for each component 
3. Review and refine the markdown for clarity and completeness

## 3. Solution Archetypes Explored
**Approaches discussed:** 
1. Pattern matching approach: Having the agent see patterns between problems and core beliefs
2. Relevance identification approach: Agent surfaces which belief is most relevant for a given problem

**Additional paradigms to consider:**
- Ranking approach: Score each problem on alignment with each belief
- Generative approach: Have agent propose problems that would align with beliefs
- Elimination approach: Identify anti-patterns of problems misaligned with beliefs

## 4. The Crux Identified
**Core constraint:** Getting the agent to understand Michael's context and core beliefs deeply enough to elicit what makes a problem worth solving for him.
- Why it's the crux: If solved, the agent could consistently identify problems that resonate with who Michael is becoming

**Crux clarification:** 
- "What if the real crux is defining 'understanding' in this context - what observable agent behaviors would demonstrate it has understood you?"

## 5. Crux Solutions Deep Dive
**Tactical approaches to the crux:**
1. **Explicit mapping:** Manually map each belief to characteristics of meaningful problems. First step: List 3 criteria for each belief.
2. **Worked examples:** Provide examples of past problems and label which beliefs they connected to. First step: Identify 3 past meaningful problems.
3. **Belief-problem scoring:** Have the agent score a set of problems on alignment with each belief. First step: Generate 10 sample problems to score.

## 6. Belief System Integration
**Current beliefs affecting this problem:**
- Empowering belief: My core beliefs can serve as a guide for what problems are worth solving (implied)

**New beliefs emerging:**
- "An AI system can understand me at a level to select problems aligned with my purpose"
- "It's okay to let an agent guide me toward my most meaningful work"

**Belief experiment:** 
"What if I believed that every problem is an opportunity to express my core beliefs? How would I describe problems differently to the agent?"

## 7. Fact Check & Assumptions
- ✅ Michael has provided his core beliefs as context to the agent
- ❓ The agent can identify patterns between problems and beliefs 
- ❓ Seeing the agent make these connections would be meaningful for Michael

## 8. Just One More Thing...
"I noticed you mentioned being 'surprised' by the agent's ability to identify important problems. Just one more thing... what if you also challenged it to surprise you with problems you've never considered but that still align with your beliefs?"

## Evaluation Summary
**Key coaching moves that worked well:**
- Reflecting Michael's energy and vision back to him
- Progressively deepening the exploration from task to beliefs
- Inviting Michael to envision the experience of the agent understanding him

**Areas for improvement:**
- Clarifying the time expectation for today's task
- Exploring a wider range of solution archetypes
- Probing more into the "why" behind the importance of this problem

**Overall coaching effectiveness score:** 7/10
The coach effectively uncovered the deeper significance of the problem and helped Michael connect it to his beliefs. The exploration flowed naturally and maintained an energizing tone. However, a few key gaps remained in concretizing today's task and pushing the range of solutions considered.

## Conversation Transcript
Michael: good morning

Coach: Good morning, Michael! 

I'm here as your thinking partner for whatever's stirring in you today - whether that's reflecting on yesterday, processing something current, or exploring what's ahead.

What's alive for you right now that you'd like to explore together?

Michael: I want to get to multi-agent systems today... at least start on making it

Coach: There's something energizing about that intention - "at least start on making it" suggests both ambition and practicality.

What would constitute a meaningful "start" for you today that would leave you feeling like you've genuinely begun this journey into multi-agent systems?

Michael: making the session 7 markdown, describing the approach would be a good step

Coach: That sounds like a concrete foundation - creating the session 7 markdown to describe your approach.

When you imagine yourself sitting down to write that markdown, what specific aspect of the multi-agent systems approach feels most important for you to capture first?

Michael: Getting the todo list fetch to really sing

Coach: That phrase "really sing" has such energy to it - there's clearly something about the todo list fetch that you want to elevate beyond just functional.

What would it look like when that todo list fetch is truly "singing" - what quality or capability would make you feel like it's reached that level?

Michael: I get surprised how good the agent is at capturing the most important problem from my to dos

Coach: That's a beautiful vision - being genuinely surprised by how well the agent identifies what matters most from your todos.

What do you think would need to be true about how the agent processes or understands your todos for it to consistently surface insights that surprise you with their accuracy?

Michael: It would need to first get the right ones.. then understand me underneath and my context to elicit what 'makes for a good problem to solve'

Coach: There's such depth in that progression - first the right todos, then understanding you underneath, then grasping what makes a problem worth solving for you specifically.

When you think about that middle piece - the agent understanding "you underneath" - what aspects of yourself would be most crucial for it
