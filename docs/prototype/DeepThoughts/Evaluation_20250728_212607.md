## Coaching Session Evaluation Report

**Overall Effectiveness Score: 73.0%**

### Evaluation Criteria

**A. Problem Definition: ✓**
   The session successfully helped the client identify and define their biggest problem: transforming anxiety about starting at Jabra into genuine excitement by finding pathways to leverage his unique strengths in empowering engineers and creating radical organizational simplification. The conversation clearly established why this matters - it's not just about job preparation, but about his core vision of making engineers 'closest to the keyboards' call the shots in an AI-first approach. The significance is well-articulated through the exploration of his unique strengths (empowering engineers, simplifying organizations) and the conditions needed for success (smart engineers in Poland, openness to transformation). The Deep Thoughts report further reinforces this by framing it as 'an experiment in organizational physics' with industry-transforming potential, showing the client understands both the personal and broader significance of solving this challenge.

**B. Crux Recognition: ✓**
   The session successfully identified the key constraint preventing progress. While the client initially presented surface-level concerns about job preparation and anxiety, the coaching systematically peeled back layers to reveal the true crux: discovering whether Jabra has the foundational conditions (openness to transformation and autonomous, forward-thinking engineers) necessary for the radical organizational simplification the client envisions. The conversation distinguished between symptoms (anxiety about starting) and root causes (uncertainty about whether the transformation vision is viable), and clearly established what must be addressed first - assessing Rajat's mindset and the R&D culture's readiness for change. The Deep Thoughts report further crystallizes this crux as 'Can you identify and activate the conditions for a radical simplification where engineers closest to the keyboards drive decisions?' This represents deep analysis that goes well beyond the initial surface-level job preparation concerns.

**C. Today Accomplishment: ✗**
   While the conversation identified the crux (discovering pathways where Michael can reshape Jabra's approach through engineer empowerment) and the Deep Thoughts report provided excellent strategic frameworks, neither the conversation nor the report defined a specific, concrete action for TODAY. The conversation ended abruptly when Michael asked to 'move on' and then 'close conversation' before any today-specific actions were established. The Deep Thoughts report offers three strategic approaches and a 90-day timeline but lacks specific actions for the immediate day. There's no clear, measurable task that Michael could complete today to address his crux of transforming anxiety into excitement through identifying viable pathways at Jabra.

**D. Multiple Paths: 90.0%**
   The Deep Thoughts report excellently presents three genuinely distinct approaches to organizational transformation: The Trojan Horse (start small with proof of concept), The Evangelical Revival (create a movement through hearts and minds), and The Architectural Jujitsu (use existing structure against itself). Each path represents a fundamentally different strategy with clearly articulated pros and cons. The report goes beyond just listing options by providing a detailed implementation roadmap for the Architectural Jujitsu approach, showing how it would unfold over 90 days. The paths are creative and well-differentiated - one focuses on stealth and gradual change, another on open advocacy and momentum-building, and the third on political maneuvering within existing systems. The only minor limitation is that while the conversation touched on the crux, the multiple paths were primarily developed in the Deep Thoughts rather than explored collaboratively during the live coaching session.

**E. Core Beliefs: 90.0%**
   The session demonstrates exceptional connection to the client's core beliefs and values. The Deep Thoughts report explicitly identifies and builds upon Michael's fundamental beliefs: that customers 'hire' products to solve concrete struggles (applied to engineers as internal customers), his 'go slow to go fast' coding philosophy (applied to organizational transformation), and introduces a new aligned belief about 'organizational structures making themselves obsolete.' The recommendations are deeply rooted in his core value of empowering engineers closest to the keyboards, with all three transformation paths (Trojan Horse, Evangelical Revival, Architectural Jujitsu) designed around this central tenet. The report consistently references his belief in radical simplification and AI-first approaches as guiding principles. The only minor gap is that while the conversation touched on these beliefs, it could have made the connection more explicit during the live coaching rather than primarily in the synthesis.

### Conversation Summary

## Conversation Summary

This coaching session focused on Michael's upcoming transition to a new role at Jabra, starting Friday. What initially appeared as job preparation anxiety quickly revealed itself as a deeper challenge: transforming his nervous energy into genuine excitement by identifying pathways where his unique strengths could reshape the organization's approach to software development.

The conversation uncovered Michael's bold vision for organizational transformation - empowering engineers closest to the code to make key decisions while radically simplifying the traditional hierarchy. His core insight was that this transformation hinges on two critical conditions: having smart engineers (particularly in the Poland hub) and finding genuine openness to new approaches, especially AI-first development practices. Through probing questions, it became clear that while engineering talent could be developed, the real make-or-break factor was organizational willingness to embrace fundamental change, evidenced by developers already autonomously choosing cutting-edge tools like Cursor.

The session identified Rajat, from the R&D organization, as Michael's key strategic partner and entry point for understanding the existing culture. However, the conversation revealed a fascinating paradox: Michael needs Rajat to help make both of their traditional roles (architect and product manager) obsolete by empowering engineers to bypass hierarchical approval processes entirely. The coaching helped Michael recognize that his anxiety might not stem from lack of preparation, but from the magnitude of the transformation he envisions - essentially rewiring how a traditional hardware company creates technological value in the AI age.

### Full Conversation Transcript

**User**: Good morning

**Assistant**: Good morning, Michael! 

What feels like the most pressing challenge you need to crack today - the one that's been quietly tugging at your attention?

**User**: Really getting going on Jabra - preparing for my new job and being excited about it

**Assistant**: That's exciting - stepping into something new at Jabra! 

What makes this preparation feel so crucial right now, rather than something you could ease into once you start?

**User**: I start on Friday... starting to feel anxious about it, and not excited enough. I know I'll get excited once I go deeper

**Assistant**: Ah, so the real challenge isn't just preparation - it's transforming that underlying anxiety into genuine excitement before you walk through the door on Friday.

What do you think is at the heart of that anxiety? What's the core thing that, if you could shift it, would unlock that excitement you know is waiting underneath?

**User**: If I see a few pathways, where I can play on my unique strengths and really pivot our approaches or mindset around the problems

**Assistant**: So you're looking to identify specific pathways where your unique strengths could genuinely reshape how they approach their challenges.

What are those unique strengths of yours that feel most ready to make an impact - the ones where you think "if they could just see how I approach this differently..."?

**User**: Empowering engineers - not product managers or architects, but engineers. Getting the people closest to the keyboards to call the shots. I envision a radically simplified organization

**Assistant**: That's a powerful vision - engineers closest to the keyboards calling the shots in a radically simplified structure.

What would need to be true about the current situation at Jabra for this vision to feel not just possible, but inevitable once they experience it?

**User**: 1 - I need super smart engineers in the hub in Poland, 2 - I need to see a real willingness to work differently - e.g., implemeting claude code everywhere

**Assistant**: So you need both the right people (super smart engineers in Poland) and the right mindset (willingness to embrace new approaches like Claude code implementation).

Of these two conditions, which one feels more within your ability to assess and influence in your first few weeks - and what would be your earliest signal that it's actually there?

**User**: Smartness of the engineers in Poland... however, I envision that this can be changed... as long as people are open to the other part. I'd really love to make a transformation to an AI first approach here

**Assistant**: So the openness to transformation - especially toward an AI-first approach - is the real make-or-break factor, since you believe you can develop the engineering talent if that foundation exists.

What would you actually observe in those first conversations that would tell you "yes, these people are genuinely open to reimagining how they work" versus just politely nodding along?

**User**: I'd want to see examples of situtations where the devs picked their own tools already... want to see strong use of cursor or similar already

**Assistant**: Ah, so you're looking for evidence that they're already self-directed tool choosers - developers who've independently adopted cutting-edge tools like Cursor without being mandated to.

What's your plan for discovering this in your first week - how will you create the right conversations or observations to uncover whether this autonomous, forward-thinking behavior already exists?

**User**: THis is about the R&D organization... I need to understand that one really well - starting with Rajat as a partner in crime

**Assistant**: So Rajat becomes your key entry point into understanding the R&D culture and identifying whether that autonomous, tool-choosing mindset exists.

What's the most important thing you need to discover about Rajat himself in those early conversations - the insight that would tell you whether he could truly be your "partner in crime" for this transformation?

**User**: His mindset of going beyond his own org (the architects)... I'd love to circumvent architects AND product managers here, basically making Rajat and my organization redundant...

**Assistant**: That's a fascinating paradox - you need Rajat to help you make both of your roles obsolete by empowering engineers to bypass the traditional hierarchy entirely.

What would Rajat need to believe about organizational structure and his own role for him to genuinely embrace this radical simplification, rather than unconsciously protect his position?

**User**: Can we move on

**Assistant**: What else is pulling at your attention this morning?

**User**: close conversation

**Assistant**: Take care, Michael. Looking forward to hearing how Friday goes!
