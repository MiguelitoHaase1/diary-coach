# Deep Thoughts: The Algorithmic Erasure of Self

## The Feynman Paradox

In 1965, Richard Feynman famously refused to use the newly installed computers at Caltech for his quantum electrodynamics calculations. Not because he distrusted the machines, but because he feared that without doing the calculations by hand, he would lose his intuitive grasp of the physics. "The worthwhile problems," he said, "are the ones you can really solve or help solve, the ones you can really contribute something to... No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something about it."

Today, you face a modern variant of Feynman's dilemma: as GenAI becomes your co-author, are you trading the struggle that sharpens thought for the convenience that dulls it?

## Today's Crux

The problem crystallizes beautifully in your observation: "With GenAI, it is just so easy and convenient to get to something smart enough to share... and not so much mine, so I have a hard time editing and improving it."

This isn't merely about writing quality. It's about the erosion of intellectual ownership—that deep, bone-level understanding of your own ideas that only comes from wrestling them into existence. When you described how your first draft was "turned around 180 degrees" in rewriting, you weren't just editing text. You were forging neural pathways, building the very architecture of your thinking.

The crux today: How do you sharpen your core beliefs into controversial, meaningful statements while using GenAI as a tool rather than a crutch? How do you maintain that "kernel of personality and individualism" when the path of least resistance leads to algorithmic homogenization?

## Three Archetypes of Solution

### 1. The Amish Approach: Strategic Luddism
Like the Amish who carefully evaluate each technology against their values, you could create strict boundaries around GenAI use. Perhaps GenAI never touches your core beliefs document. Perhaps certain sacred texts remain purely human-crafted.

**Pros:** Preserves the purity of struggle. Guarantees authentic ownership. Forces deep thinking.

**Cons:** Artificially limits your tools. May become unsustainable as GenAI becomes ubiquitous. Risks becoming precious about process over outcome.

### 2. The Jazz Musician: Improvisational Partnership
Jazz musicians don't abandon their instruments when playing with others—they use the ensemble to push their own boundaries. You could treat GenAI as a sparring partner, using it to generate provocative alternatives that you then wrestle with, reverse, and transform.

**Pros:** Leverages GenAI's strength while maintaining creative control. Creates productive friction. Accelerates ideation while preserving struggle.

**Cons:** Requires discipline to maintain the wrestling phase. Easy to slip into passive acceptance. Demands clear process boundaries.

### 3. The Master Chef: Mise en Place for Thought
Great chefs use sous chefs and modern equipment, but they taste everything, adjust constantly, and maintain absolute ownership of the final dish. You could use GenAI for preparation—research, initial structures, alternative phrasings—while reserving synthesis, judgment, and final crafting for yourself.

**Pros:** Maximizes efficiency without sacrificing ownership. Clear delineation of human vs. machine roles. Scalable approach.

**Cons:** Requires strong mental discipline. Risk of gradual boundary erosion. May still reduce certain types of struggle.

## Deep Dive: The Jazz Approach

Imagine approaching your core beliefs document like Miles Davis approached "Kind of Blue"—with a clear vision but open to radical improvisation. Here's how this might unfold:

First, you write your initial belief statement by hand (or typing directly): "I believe in deep customer understanding."

Then, you prompt GenAI: "Challenge this belief. What would someone who fundamentally disagrees argue? What's the most provocative 'even over' statement I could add?"

GenAI might respond: "Even over immediate revenue opportunities" or "Even over team consensus" or "Even over technical elegance."

But here's where the jazz happens. You don't accept these suggestions—you use them as provocations. Maybe "even over immediate revenue" feels too safe. So you push harder: "Deep customer understanding even over shipping fast." No, still not sharp enough. "Deep customer understanding even over my own brilliant ideas."

Now you're wrestling. The GenAI suggestions aren't answers—they're resistance training for your mind. You're still doing the hard thinking, but with a tireless sparring partner who can throw unexpected punches.

## Belief System Alignment

Your existing principle of "go slow to go fast" maps perfectly here. Just as you're deliberately setting up your coding environment to avoid black-box dependencies, you can approach GenAI writing with the same philosophy. The slowness isn't inefficiency—it's the deliberate cultivation of understanding.

A new belief emerging from this conversation might be: "Intellectual ownership through productive struggle, even over efficient output." This isn't anti-technology; it's pro-cognition. It's recognizing that some inefficiencies are features, not bugs.

## Just One More Thing...

You know, there's something curious here. You mentioned wanting to make your beliefs "more controversial" by adding "even over" statements. But what if the real controversy isn't in the beliefs themselves, but in your relationship with the tools you use to express them?

Looking at your task list, I see "Adapt prompts to improve setup to 10 star experience." What if the 10-star experience isn't about perfect prompts, but about perfect friction? What if the highest quality experience includes strategic struggle?

Perhaps the crux isn't just about protecting your thinking from GenAI, but about designing an intentionally imperfect system—one that forces you to engage deeply precisely because it doesn't give you everything you want on the first try.

## Conclusion

This isn't a problem to be solved once and filed away. It's a dynamic tension to be managed, like a surfer reading waves. The ocean's power could destroy you or carry you to shore—the art lies in the engagement.

Your core beliefs document isn't just a file to be edited. It's a living manifesto of who you choose to be in an age of algorithmic abundance. Every "even over" statement is a declaration of independence, a line in the sand that says: "This is where I choose friction over flow, struggle over speed, authenticity over efficiency."

The ceiling here isn't just high—it's infinite. Because what you're really building isn't a document, but a practice. A way of being with technology that enhances rather than replaces your thinking. A jazz ensemble where you're always the lead, even when—especially when—the AI is playing alongside you.
