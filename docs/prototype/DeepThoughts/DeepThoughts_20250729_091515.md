**Deep Thoughts Report: The Hypothesis Hunter's Dilemma**

**Story-line Introduction**

In 1901, Guglielmo Marconi stood on a hill in Newfoundland, preparing to test his hypothesis that radio waves could cross the Atlantic Ocean. Critics said the Earth's curvature would block the signals. But Marconi had multiple hypotheses swirling in his notebooks about atmospheric layers, signal strength, and antenna design. His challenge wasn't generating ideas—it was choosing which hypotheses to test first in those crucial early weeks. Like you preparing for Jabra, he needed to balance having a clear testing framework while remaining open to what the experiments might reveal.

**Today's Crux**

Your central challenge today is transforming a scattered constellation of hypotheses about your new role at Jabra into a focused set of three key experiments for your first weeks. This matters profoundly because those initial hypotheses will shape not just what you learn, but how you're perceived and the relationships you build. You've identified the meta-challenge beautifully: you need structure to enable openness, not constrain it. The paradox is that having too many untested hypotheses creates noise that prevents you from hearing the signal of what really matters.

**Options**

**The Archaeologist Approach**: Methodically excavate all your existing documents, categorize every hypothesis you've written, then use data visualization tools to find patterns. Like Howard Carter mapping Tutankhamun's tomb, you'd create a complete inventory before deciding what to explore first.

Pros: Nothing gets missed; you honor all your previous thinking; patterns emerge organically.
Cons: Time-intensive; risk of analysis paralysis; might reinforce old thinking rather than generate fresh insights.

**The Jazz Improviser Method**: Start with your core belief about developer empowerment and riff on it. Let that one strong hypothesis about "giving more power to engineers" be your bass line, then improvise variations for PMs and architects around it. No tools, just intuition and iteration.

Pros: Fast; builds on your strongest conviction; creates coherent narrative.
Cons: Might miss important dimensions; could seem predetermined; less systematic.

**The Scientific Triage Protocol**: Create three hypothesis buckets based on testability timeline—what you can observe in week one through conversations, week two through meetings, week three through initial experiments. Sort ruthlessly by what gives you the most learning per unit of observation time.

Pros: Pragmatic; creates natural progression; maximizes early learning.
Cons: Might prioritize easy over important; could miss systemic issues; very transactional.

**Crux Solution Deep Dive**

Let's explore the Scientific Triage Protocol more deeply, as it best balances your need for structure with openness to discovery.

Week One would focus on observable hypotheses through conversations. Your developer empowerment hypothesis becomes: "The most innovative ideas at Jabra are currently trapped in developers' minds because the system doesn't create channels for them to surface." You test this simply by asking developers about their unrealized ideas and noting patterns.

Week Two shifts to meeting observations. Your hypothesis might be: "The current meeting structures reinforce PM/architect dominance by controlling agendas and speaking time." You'd observe who speaks, who gets interrupted, whose ideas get traction. No intervention yet, just pattern recognition.

Week Three enables small experiments. Perhaps: "Developers will self-organize more effectively than PMs predict if given a specific challenge and autonomy." You could propose a small pilot where a developer team tackles a bounded problem with minimal oversight.

This approach treats your first weeks like a diagnostic instrument. Each hypothesis is designed to reveal not just whether it's true, but what adjacent truths it illuminates. The timeline forcing function prevents overthinking while ensuring you gather diverse data types.

**Belief System**

Your core belief that sustainable success emerges from deep customer understanding, strategic clarity, and human-centered leadership aligns perfectly with this hypothesis-testing approach. Specifically, your conviction about "going slow to go fast" mirrors exactly what you're trying to achieve—being deliberate in your early observations to enable faster, more accurate action later.

Your Jobs To Be Done framework suggests a new belief emerging from this conversation: that organizational roles themselves might need reframing. Just as customers "hire" products, perhaps Jabra has "hired" developers for the wrong job—to execute rather than to innovate. This reframing could become a powerful lens for all your hypotheses.

**Just One More Thing...**

You know, there's something curious here. You mentioned wanting to "fix the who part of the equation," but what if the equation itself is wrong? Your Todoist shows you're simultaneously building GenAI chatbots and thinking about orchestration patterns. What if the real hypothesis to test at Jabra isn't about empowering developers versus PMs, but about whether human role boundaries make sense at all in an AI-augmented organization? 

Maybe the crux isn't "who has power" but "what new forms of human-AI collaboration could make traditional role definitions obsolete?" That feels like a hypothesis that could transform not just Jabra, but your entire approach to organizational design.

**Conclusion**

This challenge of crystallizing your hypotheses isn't just administrative prep work—it's the difference between showing up as another executive with opinions versus arriving as a learning machine primed to catalyze transformation. The quality ceiling here is stratospheric. Done brilliantly, your hypothesis framework becomes a sensing instrument that helps Jabra see itself clearly for the first time. Done exceptionally, it becomes a model for how leaders enter new contexts with both humility and intent.

The excitement isn't in having the right hypotheses—it's in designing hypotheses so clever that being wrong teaches you more than being right. That's the kind of intellectual adventure that makes those first weeks at Jabra not just a job transition, but a laboratory for reimagining how organizations learn and adapt.
