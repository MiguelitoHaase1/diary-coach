## Coaching Session Evaluation Report

**Overall Effectiveness Score: 69.0%**

### Evaluation Criteria

**A. Problem Definition: ✓**
   The session successfully helped Michael identify and define his biggest problem: transforming Deep Eval reports from dry summaries into compelling narratives he can't stop listening to. The conversation clearly explored why this matters - these reports are his primary tool for reflection and growth, and they should energize his thinking rather than just document it. Michael articulated the significance through multiple dimensions: wanting to feel excited about listening, feeling like he's getting smarter, and having reports that pull him in completely. The Deep Thoughts report explicitly states this problem and its importance in section 1, demonstrating clear problem definition and understanding of why it matters.

**B. Crux Recognition: ✓**
   The session successfully identified the key constraint preventing progress. While Michael initially focused on the surface-level task of 'prompt engineering,' the coaching conversation revealed the deeper crux: transforming reports from dry summaries into compelling narratives that create genuine engagement. The Deep Thoughts report clearly articulates this as 'How to engineer prompts that generate narrative-driven insights rather than report-style summaries.' This goes beyond the symptom (boring reports) to identify the root constraint (lack of narrative structure and emotional engagement in the prompt design). The session recognized that addressing narrative structure and intelligence amplification must come first to unlock the desired transformation in Michael's coaching experience.

**C. Today Accomplishment: ✗**
   While the conversation identified the crux (engineering prompts for narrative-driven insights) and the Deep Thoughts report provided multiple tactical approaches, there is no specific, concrete action defined for TODAY. The report mentions 'Creating tasks in your Todoist...' but doesn't specify what those tasks are. The client needs to know exactly what to do today - whether it's rewriting specific prompts, testing particular narrative structures, or implementing one of the three tactics mentioned. Without a clear, actionable next step that can be completed today, this criterion is not met.

**D. Multiple Paths: 80.0%**
   The Deep Thoughts report presents three genuinely distinct approaches to address the crux of creating compelling narrative-driven reports: The Hero's Journey Structure (quest narrative), The Socratic Dialogue (conversational format), and The Pattern Detective (mystery/discovery format). These are meaningfully different approaches - one uses storytelling archetypes, another uses dialogue format, and the third uses suspense/revelation structure. The report also explores the underlying framework through the Jobs To Be Done lens, showing functional, emotional, and social dimensions. However, while the paths are creative and distinct, there's limited exploration of trade-offs or implementation challenges for each approach, which prevents a perfect score.

**E. Core Beliefs: 70.0%**
   The session demonstrates good connection to core beliefs with explicit reference to Michael's Jobs To Be Done framework in section 4, showing how the Deep Eval report serves functional, emotional, and social jobs. The report also introduces a new aligned belief about insights feeling like stories. However, the connection could be deeper - while JTBD is mentioned, other core values that likely drive Michael (like continuous improvement, systems thinking, or narrative power) aren't explicitly surfaced or leveraged. The solutions are well-aligned with what matters to him (feeling smarter, narrative engagement), but the belief system integration feels somewhat surface-level rather than deeply woven throughout the recommendations.

### Conversation Summary

## Coaching Session Summary

This session focused on Michael's goal to transform his Deep Eval reports from dry, summary-style content into compelling narratives that would genuinely excite him to listen to. The conversation explored what would make these reports irresistible - moving beyond mere documentation of coaching insights to creating content that feels like an engaging story he can't stop consuming. Michael identified two key elements: crafting reports in a narrative essay format and providing deep context around problems that makes him feel excited about solving them.

## Key Insights

The core insight that emerged was Michael's desire to feel like he's "getting smarter" while listening to his reports. This revealed that the reports serve multiple functions beyond simple summarization - they need to be intelligence amplifiers that help him see familiar challenges from fresh perspectives and discover new connections in his thinking. The Deep Thoughts report identified this as a Jobs To Be Done challenge, where the reports are "hired" not just for functional synthesis, but for emotional engagement and social validation of his growth as a thinker.

## Action Items

The session generated specific tactical approaches for prompt engineering, including structuring reports as hero's journey narratives, creating Socratic dialogues between present and future versions of Michael, and framing insights as detective stories that build suspense toward breakthrough revelations. The ultimate goal is to engineer prompts that transform coaching conversations into compelling audio content that energizes rather than just informs, with a particular focus on ending each report with powerful questions that continue to influence his thinking throughout the week.

### Full Conversation Transcript

**User**: Good morning

**Assistant**: Good morning, Michael!

What feels like the most pressing challenge you want to untangle today?

**User**: Today is all about actually doing the prompt engineering, like really changing the prompts so that we get the maximum out of the coach agent.

**Assistant**: What would "maximum" look like for you - what specific transformation are you hoping the enhanced prompts will create in your coaching experience?

**User**: I expect it to lead to a dramatically better Deep Eval report than I can actually listen to by the end of the day on Speechify, and feel excited about.

**Assistant**: What's the gap between the current Deep Eval reports and one that would genuinely excite you to listen to?

**User**: It currently feels like a report, like something that gives a summary and a feeling of what has happened. I want to feel it like something that's exciting and I cannot stop listening to.

**Assistant**: What would make you unable to stop listening - is it the insights themselves, the way they're revealed, or something else entirely about how the content connects with you?

**User**: Good question. I believe it has to be:

**Assistant**: I'm listening - what do you believe it has to be?

**User**: - Just a good narrative story, you know, in an essay form

**Assistant**: What makes a narrative story truly gripping for you - what elements pull you in so completely that you lose track of time while listening?

**User**: - Really going deep on understanding the problem I wanted to solve and giving me context around that problem so I feel excited about solving it

**Assistant**: What would that deep understanding reveal about your problem that you don't currently see - what missing context do you sense is there waiting to be uncovered?

**User**: I feel like I'm getting smarter by listening to this.

**Assistant**: What would make you feel like you're genuinely getting smarter - is it discovering new connections, seeing familiar things from fresh angles, or something else about how your thinking evolves while listening?
