## Coaching Session Evaluation Report

**Overall Effectiveness Score: 80.0%**

### Evaluation Criteria

**A. Problem Definition: ✓**
   The session successfully helped Michael identify and define his biggest problem: developing a strategic questioning framework to identify key people to invest in and determine where to radically change approach at his new job at Jabra starting Friday. The coach guided him from his initial surface-level desire to 'feel 10X better at Obsidian' to the deeper, more critical challenge of strategic preparation for his new role. Michael clearly articulated why this matters - he needs to be ready to make impact from day one, and the significance is evident given the time pressure (starting Friday) and the strategic nature of the role. The conversation explicitly moved from symptoms (wanting better Obsidian skills) to the root problem (strategic preparation for leadership at Jabra), with clear understanding of its importance for his success.

**B. Crux Recognition: ✓**
   The session successfully identified the key constraint (crux) preventing Michael's progress. The conversation moved from surface-level symptoms ('wanting to feel 10X better at Obsidian') to the root cause: needing a strategic questioning framework to identify key people and transformation opportunities at his new job at Jabra starting Friday. The coach helped Michael recognize that his real challenge wasn't about Obsidian proficiency itself, but about preparing strategically for his new role. The session went deeper to identify the specific bottleneck - how to identify informal power brokers and change catalysts within Jabra's culture - and recognized that building relationships with Anders (his new boss) as an intelligence source must be addressed first to unlock progress. This represents clear progression from symptoms to root causes to actionable next steps.

**C. Today Accomplishment: ✓**
   The session successfully defined specific, concrete actions for today that directly address the crux. Michael identified: 1) Ask Anders about informal power brokers and change catalysts within Jabra's culture, and 2) Ask Anders about 'how big decisions have been made in history' at Jabra. These are specific, actionable questions he can ask his new boss today. The actions directly connect to his crux of developing a strategic questioning framework to identify key people to invest in and determine where to radically change approach. The actions are achievable (he has access to Anders) and measurable (he can literally ask these questions). The session moved from vague desire to 'feel 10X better at Obsidian' to concrete preparation steps for his Friday start date.

**D. Multiple Paths: 20.0%**
   The conversation identified a single primary approach: using Anders (the new boss) as the main intelligence source to understand power dynamics and decision-making history at Jabra. While this is a solid strategy, the session did not explore multiple distinct paths forward. The conversation focused narrowly on questioning Anders about informal power brokers and historical decision patterns, without considering alternative approaches such as: conducting broader stakeholder interviews, analyzing organizational charts and reporting structures, observing meeting dynamics, researching company culture through external sources, or building relationships with peers at his level first. The session also didn't explore trade-offs between different relationship-building versus change-driving strategies, or consider the implications of relying heavily on one person (Anders) for intelligence gathering.

**E. Core Beliefs: 20.0%**
   The conversation shows minimal connection to Michael's core beliefs and values. While there are brief mentions of his 'go slow to go fast' philosophy and Jobs To Be Done framework in the context provided, these aren't actively referenced or integrated into the coaching dialogue itself. The conversation focuses primarily on tactical preparation (questioning strategies, identifying key people) without connecting these approaches to Michael's deeper principles or values. The Deep Thoughts report is invoked but not shown, so we cannot assess whether it made these crucial connections. The session lacks explicit exploration of what matters most to Michael beyond the immediate job preparation, missing opportunities to align the strategic approach with his core tenets and beliefs.

**Assistant**: Good morning, Michael! 

I can feel the energy of a fresh day ahead. What's stirring in your mind as the most important challenge you want to crack today?

**User**: Today, I just want to feel 10X better at Obsidian, and then move outside and enjoy it

**Assistant**: That's a beautiful combination - mastering a tool that serves your thinking, then stepping into the world to savor it! 

What would "10X better at Obsidian" actually look like for you today - what specific breakthrough or capability would make you feel that leap forward?

**User**: I can see the value from putting everything into Obsedian --- not just via claude code but by itself

**Assistant**: Ah, so you're sensing there's something powerful about Obsidian's native capabilities that you haven't fully unlocked yet - beyond just using it as a Claude integration point.

What's pulling you toward exploring Obsidian on its own terms today?

**User**: I need to prepare for Jabra

**Assistant**: Now we're getting to the heart of it - preparing for Jabra feels like the real driver here, and you're sensing that mastering Obsidian could be key to that preparation.

What about this Jabra preparation feels most critical or time-sensitive right now?

**User**: I start new job at Jabra Friday... exciting!

**Assistant**: Congratulations, Michael! Starting Friday - that's incredibly exciting and explains the urgency perfectly.

What aspect of getting ready for this new role at Jabra feels like the biggest challenge or opportunity you need to tackle before Friday?

What initial thoughts or considerations about Jabra, the role, or your approach are already swirling in your mind that would be valuable context for diving deeper?

**User**: the people question... particularly, which are the key people to invest in, and where to radically change our approach

**Assistant**: That's fascinating - you're already thinking strategically about relationship mapping and transformation opportunities. The tension between building the right alliances and identifying where bold change is needed.

This seems like the foundational question that could unlock both your people strategy and your change approach - what's your initial instinct about how to spot these key players?
