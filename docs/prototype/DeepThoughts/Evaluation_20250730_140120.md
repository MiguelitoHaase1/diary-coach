## Coaching Session Evaluation Report

**Overall Effectiveness Score: 96.0%**

### Evaluation Criteria

**A. Problem Definition: ✓**
   The session successfully helped Michael identify and define his biggest problem: developing a strategic questioning framework to identify key people to invest in and determine where to radically change approach at his new job at Jabra starting Friday. The conversation progressed from his initial vague desire to 'feel 10X better at Obsidian' to clearly articulating the real challenge - preparing strategically for his new role. Michael explicitly understood why this matters: he needs to be positioned to learn effectively and make impact from day one. The significance was well-established through the urgency of starting Friday and his recognition that success depends on understanding both relationship dynamics and transformation opportunities. The assistant helped him move from surface-level tool mastery to the deeper strategic challenge of organizational navigation.

**B. Crux Recognition: ✓**
   The session successfully identified the key constraint preventing Michael's progress. Initially, he presented surface-level symptoms (wanting to feel '10X better at Obsidian'), but through strategic questioning, the coach helped him recognize the real crux: developing a strategic questioning framework to identify key people and change opportunities at his new job at Jabra starting Friday. The conversation distinguished between the tool mastery symptom and the root cause of needing to prepare strategically for organizational success. The coach explicitly named this as 'the crux' and helped Michael recognize that understanding Jabra's power dynamics and decision-making patterns must be addressed first to unlock his effectiveness in the new role. The Deep Thoughts report further reinforced this analysis by comparing it to mapping organizational 'electrical circuits' and emphasizing that relationship intelligence combined with transformation strategy is the foundational challenge that will determine his impact.

**C. Today Accomplishment: ✓**
   The session successfully helped Michael define specific, concrete actions for today that directly address his crux. He identified: 1) Having a strategic conversation with Anders (his new boss) to ask about informal power brokers and change catalysts, and 2) Asking Anders specifically about 'how big decisions have been made in history' at Jabra. These are clear, actionable steps he can take today to prepare for his Friday start date. The actions directly connect to his crux of developing a strategic questioning framework to identify key people and change opportunities. The Deep Thoughts report further reinforced these concrete next steps with the Network Mapper Strategy, making his preparation both achievable and measurable through the specific questions he'll ask Anders.

**D. Multiple Paths: 90.0%**
   The Deep Thoughts report presents three genuinely distinct approaches to address the crux of understanding Jabra's organizational dynamics: The Anthropologist Approach (pure observation), The Network Mapper Strategy (systematic relationship mapping), and The Catalyst Activation Method (proactive change agent identification). Each path represents a fundamentally different philosophy - passive observation vs. analytical mapping vs. active coalition building. The report thoroughly explores trade-offs for each approach, noting pros and cons like timing risks, cultural fit concerns, and potential defensive reactions. The session then provides a detailed deep dive into the recommended Network Mapper Strategy, showing how it would work in practice with Obsidian. The only minor limitation is that while three distinct paths are presented, the exploration could have been even more comprehensive with additional creative alternatives or hybrid approaches.

**E. Core Beliefs: 80.0%**
   The session demonstrates strong connection to core beliefs and values. The Deep Thoughts report explicitly identifies and builds upon Michael's core beliefs: 'deep customer understanding, strategic clarity, and human-centered leadership' and connects these to his approach at Jabra. It references his 'Jobs To Be Done framework' as a guiding principle and applies it to understanding people. The report also acknowledges his 'go slow to go fast' principle and draws parallels between his deliberate approach to learning coding and organizational understanding. The session aligns well with what matters most to Michael - his upcoming role at Jabra and his desire for strategic preparation. However, the connection could be deeper - while the beliefs are mentioned and applied, there could have been more explicit exploration of how his values should guide specific actions and decisions at Jabra. The recommendations are well-aligned but could have been more directly anchored in his stated principles throughout the conversation.
