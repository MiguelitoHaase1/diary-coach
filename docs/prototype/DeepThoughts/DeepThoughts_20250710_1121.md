# Deep Thoughts: Becoming an AI Product Management Thought Leader

## 1. Problem Significance & Stakes
**What was established:** Michael wants to master evals and LangSmith to become a thought leader in AI product management. This would allow him to help his new team at his new company move the needle on using LLMs to create delightful user experiences in their product. 

**Missing exploration:** To further clarify the stakes:
- What specific outcomes for the company would change if you became the thought leader on this?
- How would your career trajectory be different in 1 year if you mastered this now?
- What's the opportunity cost to the team if they don't gain this LLM expertise?

## 2. Today's Concrete Task
**Task defined:** No specific task was defined for today.

**Task refinement needed:** To make progress today:
- Identify one concrete eval to write (e.g. a product feature using LLMs)
- Set success criteria (e.g. generates desired output, handles edge cases)
- Time box the task (e.g. complete draft eval in 2 hours)

## 3. Solution Archetypes Explored
**Approaches discussed:** No distinct solution approaches were discussed.

**Additional paradigms to consider:**
- Engineering approach: Dive deep into LangSmith technical capabilities 
- UX approach: Mock up the ideal LLM-powered user experience
- Strategy approach: Map out 3-month milestones to thought leadership

## 4. The Crux Identified
**Core constraint:** The conversation didn't converge on a specific crux.

**Crux clarification:** Some potential cruxes to consider:
- "The one thing that would accelerate my learning is getting feedback on evals from an expert."
- "What if the bottleneck is actually not having a clear plan for thought leadership?"
- "Could the real crux be picking the highest-impact area of LLMs to focus on first?"

## 5. Crux Solutions Deep Dive
**Tactical approaches to the crux:**
1. **Feedback loop:** Share each eval draft with an experienced LangSmith user for tips
   - First step: Identify the best person to ask and schedule a 30min feedback session
   - Why it works: Shortens learning cycle with expert guidance
   - Obstacles: Finding the right person, being open to critical feedback

2. **Thought leadership plan:** Map out key milestones and promotion channels 
   - First step: Brainstorm the top 3 things you want to be known for in this space
   - Why it works: Creates a concrete roadmap to guide learning & content creation
   - Obstacles: Prioritizing the most impactful ideas, following through consistently

3. **High-impact focus:** Pick one high-value LLM use case to master first
   - First step: List top 3 product opportunities and score by impact & difficulty
   - Why it works: Builds credibility quickly by solving a key problem extremely well
   - Obstacles: Avoiding shiny object syndrome, going deep before moving on

## 6. Belief System Integration 
**Current beliefs affecting this problem:**
- Limiting belief: I need to know everything about LLMs to be a thought leader
- Empowering belief: My team's success is a strong motivator for growth

**New beliefs emerging from this conversation:**
- "I can become an expert one high-impact use case at a time"
- "It's okay to learn in public and iterate with feedback"
- "Thought leadership is about moving key metrics, not just knowledge"

**Belief experiment:** "What if I believed I'm already adding unique value to the LLM conversation? How would I share my learning journey differently?"

## 7. Fact Check & Assumptions
- ‚úÖ Mastering evals and LangSmith are key skills for AI product managers
- ‚ùì Becoming a thought leader is the best path to moving the needle for the team
- ‚ùì The team's current bottleneck is lack of LLM expertise

## 8. Just One More Thing...
I notice you mentioned wanting to "really learn evals and use of LangSmith today". Just one more thing puzzles me... what if mastery was less about how much you learn in one day and more about consistent practice over time?

## Evaluation Summary
**Key coaching moves that worked well:**
- Clarifying the significance of the problem for Michael personally and for his team
- Probing for the specific gap between current and desired state with LLMs
- Reflecting Michael's own language around "moving the needle"

**Areas for improvement:**
- Defining a concrete task and success criteria for the day
- Exploring multiple solution approaches to unlock new thinking
- Identifying the core constraint that would make the biggest difference

**Overall coaching effectiveness score: 6/10**
The coach did a good job exploring the importance of the problem and eliciting Michael's motivations. However, the conversation stayed fairly high-level and didn't converge on a specific action plan or key constraint to focus on. With some more directive guidance on scoping today's task and considering alternative approaches, the coaching could have led to clearer next steps.
