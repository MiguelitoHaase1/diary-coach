# Deep Thoughts Report

## 1. Today's Problem
The conversation hasn't yet identified a specific problem. Michael just said good morning, and the coach asked what feels most important to solve today - but we don't have Michael's answer yet.

## 2. Today's Concrete Crux
Without a stated problem, I'll propose two radically different directions Michael might be considering:
- **Execution Archetype**: There's a specific project or task that's been lingering and needs breakthrough momentum today
- **Clarity Archetype**: There's a fuzzy strategic question that needs sharp definition before any action makes sense

## 3. Crux Solutions Deep Dive
Three tactics to identify and solve today's real crux:
1. **The 10-Minute Brain Dump**: Write continuously about what's bothering you most - the thing that woke you up at 3am
2. **The Constraint Mapping**: List everything you want to accomplish, then identify the ONE blocker that affects the most items
3. **The Energy Audit**: Notice what you're avoiding most actively - that's usually where the highest-leverage crux hides

## 4. Belief System Integration
From your core beliefs, "Progress over perfection" and "Systems thinking solves most problems" suggest starting imperfectly but systematically. Consider adding a new belief about morning clarity: "The first problem I name is rarely the real problem - dig deeper."

I notice you started with just "good morning" - no immediate problem statement. Just one more thing puzzles me... what if the real work today isn't solving a problem but first discovering which problem actually matters?

## 7. Appendix

### Conversation Transcript
**Michael**: good morning

**Coach**: Good morning, Michael! What feels like the most important problem to solve today?

### Conversation Rating

1. **Define biggest problem to solve** - and understand why this problem matters: **0** (Not yet addressed)
2. **Recognize the key constraint to address** ('the crux'): **0** (Not yet identified)
3. **Define exactly what to accomplish today** to address the crux: **0** (Conversation just started)
4. **Define multiple viable and different paths forward** to address crux: **0.7** (Deep report provides multiple approaches to identify the crux)
5. **Define which 'core beliefs'/'tenets' to focus on** when working the problem: **0.6** (Deep report connects to existing beliefs and suggests new one)

**Total Score**: 1.3/5 (26%)

### Evaluation Summary

**Key coaching moves that worked well:**
- Immediate focus on problem identification with an open-ended question
- Warm greeting that maintains rapport while moving to business

**Areas for improvement:**
- The conversation is just beginning - need Michael's response to provide meaningful analysis
- Could have asked a more specific opening question if there was context from previous sessions

**Overall coaching effectiveness score: 7/10**
The coach opened with exactly the right question - direct, open-ended, and focused on what matters most. The score reflects good technique but incomplete execution since we're only one exchange in. The real test will be how the coach responds to Michael's answer and helps him identify the true crux.
