The Edison Moment

In 1879, Thomas Edison didn't invent the light bulb by perfecting gas lamps. He reimagined the entire problem - not "how do we make better candles" but "how do we bring daylight into darkness." Similarly, when Steve Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, he didn't compete on feature parity with Microsoft. He asked a different question entirely: "What if computers were about creativity, not specifications?"

Today's Crux

Michael faces a defining moment in his new product role. The crux isn't about improving his goal-setting methodology - it's about proving he can deliver business outcomes that matter. Specifically, he needs to demonstrate that he can land a beachhead customer in 2025 for their video conferencing product, shifting the company from feature-parity mode to genuine product-market fit.

This matters profoundly because it's about establishing credibility as a business-first product leader, not someone who arrives with preconceived notions about perfect product processes. The stakes are high: prove that a video conferencing company can compete not on technical features, but on actually improving how teams work together.

Options

The Trojan Horse Approach
Start with what they expect - deliver feature parity - but embed your transformative vision within it. Like how Slack began as just another messaging app but secretly revolutionized workplace communication.
Pros: Low resistance, builds trust gradually, reduces risk of rejection
Cons: Slow transformation, might get stuck in incremental thinking, harder to show dramatic impact

The Shock Therapy Method
Completely abandon the feature roadmap and go all-in on the AI coaching concept immediately. Like how Netflix killed their DVD business overnight to focus on streaming.
Pros: Clear differentiation, fast learning, attracts innovative customers
Cons: High risk, potential internal resistance, might alienate traditional buyers

The Pilot Squadron Strategy
Create a small, empowered team to prove the new model with one sophisticated customer in two weeks, while the main organization continues as usual. Like how Lockheed's Skunk Works operated outside normal constraints to create breakthrough aircraft.
Pros: Contained risk, fast iteration, proof through action not theory
Cons: Requires exceptional execution, might create organizational tension, success depends on choosing the right beachhead

Crux Solution Deep Dive

The Pilot Squadron Strategy emerges as the most elegant solution. Here's how it would work:

Michael assembles a small, cross-functional team - perhaps just 3-4 people - with full autonomy to deliver one compelling capability within two weeks. The target: a sophisticated tech company like Spotify or Zendesk that can appreciate AI-on-edge capabilities.

The specific deliverable isn't another video conferencing feature. It's an AI avatar that conducts personalized post-meeting coaching conversations with each participant. Imagine finishing a product review at Spotify, and immediately receiving thoughtful, contextual feedback on your contribution, communication style, and impact on the meeting's outcomes.

This two-week sprint becomes a forcing function for everything Michael believes in: customer proximity, empowered teams, outcome-focused delivery. The constraint strips away process overhead and demands radical prioritization. The team ships daily, gets immediate feedback, and iterates in real-time with their beachhead customer.

Success isn't measured in features delivered but in a simple question: Does the customer believe we understand something fundamental about meeting effectiveness that no other vendor has grasped? When they see a video conferencing company that actually cares about meeting quality - not just audio quality - they recognize a true thought partner, not just another vendor.

Contextualization

This approach aligns beautifully with Michael's core beliefs. His commitment to learning-oriented leadership, evident in his Radical Candor book club planning, translates directly into a product that helps others learn and improve. His natural tendency to weave education into everything - from bedtime stories with his children to team development - makes him uniquely suited to champion a product that teaches people to communicate better.

His past experience with orchestration challenges in technical systems has taught him the value of simplicity and direct action over complex coordination. Just as he preferred fast conversation agents over slow orchestrators, he's choosing fast customer iteration over slow feature development.

The conversation also elevated a new potential core belief: that true product leadership means starting with business outcomes and working backward to methods, rather than arriving with a predetermined playbook. This customer-first, outcome-driven approach represents an evolution in his thinking about how to establish credibility and drive change.

Just One More Thing...

There's something curious here. Michael mentioned being "just supposed to be a delivery guy" for feature parity, but his personal content shows someone deeply invested in organizational health and conscious leadership. This disconnect might reveal the real crux: Is the challenge actually about proving business value, or is it about finding a way to transform an organization that's stuck in old patterns?

Looking at his other priorities - the book clubs on feedback culture, the focus on team empowerment - perhaps the beachhead customer strategy is really a Trojan horse for organizational transformation. The AI coaching product mirrors exactly what Michael wants to do internally: help people have better conversations and improve their effectiveness.

Maybe the question isn't "How do I prove I'm business-first?" but rather "How do I use a business win to catalyze the cultural change this company desperately needs?"

Conclusion

Like Edison reimagining illumination itself, Michael isn't just building another video conferencing feature. He's pioneering a new category: video conferencing that makes teams better, not just connected. The pilot squadron approach, with its two-week constraint and AI coaching innovation, becomes his tungsten filament - the breakthrough that proves a completely different approach is possible.

This isn't about incremental improvement. It's about showing that a video conferencing company can be a thought partner in organizational effectiveness. When Spotify's product teams start having markedly better meetings because of personalized AI coaching, when they realize their video vendor actually understands and improves their work, not just their bandwidth - that's when the real transformation begins.

The ceiling here is limitless. Imagine a world where every meeting makes its participants better communicators, where AI doesn't just transcribe but actively develops human capability. Michael stands at the threshold of proving this vision isn't just possible - it's two weeks away.
