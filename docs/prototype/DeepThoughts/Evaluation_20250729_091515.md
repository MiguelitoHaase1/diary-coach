## Coaching Session Evaluation Report

**Overall Effectiveness Score: 73.0%**

### Evaluation Criteria

**A. Problem Definition: ✓**
   The session successfully helped the client identify and define their biggest problem: transforming scattered hypotheses about their new Jabra role into a focused set of three key experiments for their first weeks. The client clearly articulated this as their most important challenge (Turn 3: 'I like to actually get to describe a set... that I'd like to test'). The importance was explored through multiple exchanges where the client explained why this matters - they need to 'strike the balance of having a clear mental model... but still be open' and can 'only do that if I've done this thinking upfront.' The Deep Thoughts report further crystallizes the significance, explaining that 'those initial hypotheses will shape not just what you learn, but how you're perceived and the relationships you build' and positions this as 'the difference between showing up as another executive with opinions versus arriving as a learning machine primed to catalyze transformation.' The problem definition evolved from vague to specific, and its importance was thoroughly explored and understood.

**B. Crux Recognition: ✓**
   The session successfully identified the key constraint preventing progress. The client started with a surface-level desire to 'describe hypotheses' but through coaching dialogue, the true crux emerged: transforming scattered, unfocused thinking into a structured testing framework that balances preparation with openness. The Deep Thoughts report explicitly names this as 'Today's Crux' - that having too many untested hypotheses creates noise preventing signal detection. The coaching went beyond the symptom (wanting to list hypotheses) to identify the root cause (lack of systematic approach to hypothesis prioritization and testing). The session recognized that what must be addressed first is creating a framework for hypothesis triage, not just collecting more ideas. The Scientific Triage Protocol specifically addresses this constraint by providing a time-based structure for testing hypotheses systematically.

**C. Today Accomplishment: ✗**
   While the conversation identified the crux (transforming scattered hypotheses into focused experiments for Jabra) and the Deep Thoughts report provided detailed strategic approaches, no specific concrete action for TODAY was defined. The client asked to 'move on' when the conversation was getting tactical, and then requested the deep report instead of continuing to define immediate next steps. The report offers three strategic approaches but doesn't specify what the client should actually DO today - whether that's opening a document to brain dump, using a specific tool, or taking any other concrete action. The session ended with strategic clarity but without a clear, measurable task for today.

**D. Multiple Paths: 90.0%**
   The Deep Thoughts report excellently presents three genuinely distinct approaches to address the crux of organizing scattered hypotheses: The Archaeologist Approach (systematic documentation and visualization), The Jazz Improviser Method (intuitive riffing from core beliefs), and The Scientific Triage Protocol (timeline-based testability buckets). Each path represents a fundamentally different philosophy - comprehensive analysis vs. intuitive creativity vs. pragmatic experimentation. The report thoroughly explores trade-offs for each approach, detailing specific pros and cons. It then provides a deep dive into the recommended Scientific Triage Protocol, showing how it would work in practice across three weeks. The paths are creative and well-differentiated, going beyond surface variations to offer genuinely different methodologies. The only minor limitation is that while three solid paths are presented, there could have been even more creative alternatives explored to reach a perfect score.

**E. Core Beliefs: 90.0%**
   The session demonstrates exceptional connection to the client's core beliefs and values. The Deep Thoughts report explicitly identifies and builds upon Michael's core belief system: 'sustainable success emerges from deep customer understanding, strategic clarity, and human-centered leadership' and his conviction about 'going slow to go fast.' The report skillfully connects his Jobs To Be Done framework to organizational role reframing, showing how his existing principles apply to the new context. The three solution paths (Archaeologist, Jazz Improviser, Scientific Triage) are explicitly aligned with his values - the recommended Scientific Triage Protocol directly honors his belief in systematic learning while maintaining openness. The report goes further by suggesting how his belief system is evolving, proposing that his human-centered leadership might extend to reimagining human-AI collaboration. The only minor gap is that while the conversation touched on his developer empowerment hypothesis, it could have more explicitly connected this to his broader leadership philosophy earlier in the dialogue.

### Conversation Summary

## Conversation Summary

Michael began his morning coaching session focused on a specific challenge for his upcoming role at Jabra: developing a clear set of hypotheses to test during his first few weeks. He expressed wanting to strike a balance between having a structured mental model while remaining open to discovery, recognizing that this upfront thinking was crucial for his success.

The conversation revealed that Michael had already generated numerous hypotheses scattered across various documents, but struggled with consolidating and prioritizing them. Through guided questioning, he identified that his core challenge was mapping these hypotheses to understand which were most critical for early testing. A key insight emerged around the "who" dimension - specifically his hypothesis that engineers and developers should be given more power, as current organizational dynamics might be constraining those closest to the actual building process.

The session culminated in a Deep Thoughts report that reframed Michael's challenge through the lens of scientific experimentation, proposing a three-week triage protocol for testing hypotheses based on observability and learning potential. The report suggested moving beyond traditional role-based power dynamics to consider how AI-augmented collaboration might make conventional organizational boundaries obsolete, positioning Michael's first weeks as an opportunity to become a "learning machine" rather than just another executive with opinions.

### Full Conversation Transcript

**User**: good morning

**Assistant**: Good morning, Michael! 

What's bubbling up as the most important challenge you need to crack today - the thing that, if you made real progress on it, would make everything else feel lighter?

**User**: I like to actually get to describe a set (at least three hypotheses) that I'd like to test in my questions for the first few weeks in Jabra.

**Assistant**: That sounds like it could unlock a lot of clarity for your early weeks there! 

What makes getting these hypotheses defined feel so crucial right now - is it about hitting the ground running, or something deeper about how you want to approach this new role?

**User**: I want to strike the balance of having a clear mental model of what I want to test but still be open. I can only do that if I've done this thinking upfront, I believe.

**Assistant**: That's a beautiful tension - being prepared enough to be purposeful, yet loose enough to be surprised by what you discover.

What's making it hard to land on those specific hypotheses right now - is it that there are too many possibilities swirling around, or that you're not sure which ones would actually be the most revealing to test?

**User**: What I actually feel is that potentially I have too many hypotheses swirling around in many documents. I want to get a firm you on which are the key and how can I map them up against each other.

**Assistant**: <invoke name="personal_content_agent">
<parameter name="query">Jabra hypotheses, new role preparation, testing frameworks, mental models</parameter>
</invoke>

So you've got this rich collection of thinking scattered across different places, and now you need to surface the gems and see how they connect.

What would help you recognize which hypotheses are truly the "key" ones - is it about which ones would teach you the most, or which ones would have the biggest impact if proven right or wrong?

**User**: I think if I can just map up the individual hypotheses, it'll be quite clear which ones are key, at least in the early stages.

**Assistant**: That makes sense - sometimes the act of laying them all out creates its own clarity about what matters most.

What would "mapping them up" actually look like for you - are you thinking about grouping them by theme, or plotting them against some other dimension like timing or impact?

**User**: That's one of the big questions. I believe I am going to use either Obsidian or Claude Co. to build visualizations in MindMeister or something like that.

**Assistant**: You're thinking about the tools, which suggests you're ready to move from scattered thinking to structured exploration.

What's the real decision point here - is it about which tool would help you see the connections most clearly, or are you still figuring out what kind of visualization would actually reveal the patterns you're looking for?

**User**: All of the above. I am actually quite unclear about how I can get clarity on this. I think the major thing is just to list up those upfront in a list, and then visualization will come later.

**Assistant**: <invoke name="mcp_agent">
<parameter name="query">Jabra hypotheses, new role planning, testing priorities</parameter>
</invoke>

Ah, so the first step is just getting them all out of your head and documents into one place - the simple act of listing before any fancy organizing.

What's stopping you from just opening a blank document right now and doing that brain dump of all the hypotheses you've been carrying around?

**User**: I already have a lot of documents written down. I actually want you to trawl through those documents and get a sense of what my hypotheses are already. But yeah, you're right, I can just brain dump!

**Assistant**: <invoke name="personal_content_agent">
<parameter name="query">Jabra role hypotheses, new position theories, testing assumptions, leadership approach, early priorities</parameter>
</invoke>

I can see several hypotheses emerging from your thinking - around leadership approach, organizational dynamics, and strategic priorities at Jabra. There's rich material here about testing different engagement styles and understanding the current state.

But here's what I'm curious about: as you look at what you've already captured, what feels like it's still missing from your thinking - what hypothesis do you sense you need but haven't quite articulated yet?

**User**: I have a sense there's a hypothesis around the people because you're going to start with who. So, what are my hypotheses on the product managers, the architects, the developers, and how to fix the "who" part of the equation?

**Assistant**: That's a powerful lens - the "who" as the foundation that everything else builds on.

When you think about those different roles - the PMs, architects, developers - what assumptions are you carrying about where the biggest gaps or opportunities might be in how they're currently functioning or connecting with each other?

**User**: I always have the hypothesis that we need to give more power to engineers and developers so that the PMs and architects are not good enough. We can obviously make them better, but it's better to actually lean in to developers being at the center.

**Assistant**: That's a strong hypothesis - essentially that the current power dynamics might be constraining the people who are closest to the actual building.

What would "giving more power to engineers and developers" actually look like in practice at Jabra - are you thinking about decision-making authority, or something more fundamental about how problems get defined and solved?

**User**: Can we move on?

**Assistant**: Of course.

What else is pulling at your attention this morning?

**User**: I'd like to get to the deep report

**Assistant**: <invoke name="personal_content_agent">
<parameter name="query">deep report, weekly reflection, personal insights, transformation diary</parameter>
</invoke>

What's drawing you to dive into the deep report right now - is there something specific from this week that feels like it needs processing, or is it more about maintaining that rhythm of reflection?
