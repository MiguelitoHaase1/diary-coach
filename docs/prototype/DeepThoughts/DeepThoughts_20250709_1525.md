# Deep Thoughts: Analysis Failed

## Core Problem
Unable to generate Deep Thoughts analysis due to technical error: API call failed after 3 attempts: "Could not resolve authentication method. Expected either api_key or auth_token to be set. Or for one of the `X-Api-Key` or `Authorization` headers to be explicitly omitted"

## Fact Check
‚ùå Deep Thoughts generation failed

## Just One More Thing...
The system needs debugging to provide the intended insights.

## Hints
Try running the analysis again, or check the system logs for more details.
