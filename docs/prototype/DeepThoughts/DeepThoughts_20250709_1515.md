# Deep Thoughts: Shifting from Doing to Empowering

## Core Problem
You're at a crossroads between being an individual contributor focused on flashy features and becoming a systems-builder and thought leader. The deeper challenge is learning to step back from the day-to-day doing and instead empower others to think through solutions, so you can focus on the bigger picture.

## Fact Check
✅ You want to learn LLM coding properly, not just build flashy features
✅ Updating markdown files with your learnings will help you build systems
❓ Being a thought leader means you can't also be an individual contributor
❌ Empowering others means completely stepping away from the "what" of solutions

## Just One More Thing... (Devil's Advocate)
I hear your desire to be a systems-builder and thought leader, but just one more thing puzzles me... Is it possible that diving into the details and building some flashy features yourself could actually help you better understand how to guide others and design elegant systems? Perhaps there's a middle ground where you don't have to choose between being an individual contributor and a leader.

## Hints (Without Giving Away the Answer)
- What if you timeboxed "feature factory" work to sharpen your skills while still carving out space for bigger-picture systems thinking? 
- How might you turn your feature-building work into an opportunity to mentor others and get them excited about the "what" of solutions?
- Imagine it's one year from now and you've found an ideal balance between doing and empowering. What systems and habits made that possible?

## Evaluation Summary
Key coaching moves that worked well:
- Reflecting back the core tension between individual contribution and leadership
- Probing for the deeper meaning and identity shifts behind the stated goals
- Encouraging embodied reflection on what the desired changes would feel like

Areas for improvement:
- Could push further to unpack the "why" behind the desire for thought leadership
- Missed opportunity to explore potential fears/blockers around empowering others
- Wrap up felt a bit abrupt - could use a powerful open question to end on

Overall coaching effectiveness score: 7/10 
The coaching succeeded in surfacing the core challenge and offering fresh perspectives, but could have gone deeper in places and ended more powerfully. With a few tweaks, this approach could generate real breakthroughs.

## Conversation Transcript
```
Michael: good morning

Coach: Good morning, Michael! 

I'm here as your thinking partner for whatever's stirring in you today - whether it's something you're wrestling with, celebrating, or simply noticing about yourself or your world.

What's alive for you this morning?

Michael: what could be problems to solve, given my todos for today?

Coach: I'm curious about your relationship with those todos - when you scan through what's on your list for today, what feels most charged or resistant, like there's something underneath it that wants your attention?

Michael: I'd like to set the new evals

Coach: What is it about setting these new evals that feels important enough to pull your focus right now?

Michael: It will get me to learn properly how to do llm coding--- not just be a feature factory

Coach: What would "learning properly" look like for you in contrast to the feature factory mode you've been in?

Michael: I will all the time update markdown files with my learnings-- never compromise on building a system rather than just some flashy features

Coach: When you imagine yourself consistently updating those markdown files and building systems rather than chasing flashy features, what kind of person does that make you in your own eyes?

Michael: Someone who can build systems and be a thought leader, not just an individual contributor

Coach: What would need to shift in how you approach your work today for that systems-builder and thought leader to start emerging?

Michael: Think who before what - be able to empower others to think the 'what' parts of solutions more

Coach: What does it feel like in your body when you imagine stepping into that "who before what" space - empowering others to think through solutions rather than diving straight into the doing yourself?
