# Deep Thoughts: Overcoming Perfectionism Paralysis

## Core Problem
Michael, you're grappling with a common challenge: perfectionism paralysis. Your desire to choose the "perfect" problem and have the "right conditions" before starting is causing you to avoid taking action. The deeper opportunity here is learning to embrace imperfect action and build momentum through small steps.

## Fact Check
✅ Michael has several problems he could work on today
❓ Michael needs to choose the "right" problem 
❌ Michael needs perfect conditions before starting
❌ Waiting until tomorrow will make Michael more prepared

## Just One More Thing... (Devil's Advocate)
I hear your desire to choose the perfect problem and have the right conditions, Michael. But just one more thing puzzles me... If you keep waiting for perfection, when will you ever start? Is it possible that taking imperfect action could teach you more than endless preparation?

## Hints (Without Giving Away the Answer)
- What would happen if you picked a problem at random and committed to working on it for just 10 minutes today?
- Imagine your future self looking back on today. What advice would they give you about getting started?
- Consider this: done is often better than perfect. How could you reframe "perfection" to focus on learning and progress instead of flawless execution?

## Evaluation Summary
Key coaching moves that worked well:
- Noticing the pattern of avoidance and perfectionism
- Challenging assumptions around needing perfect conditions
- Encouraging small, imperfect actions to build momentum

Areas for improvement:
- Could push Michael harder to commit to a specific tiny action 
- Missed opportunity to explore deeper fears/beliefs driving perfectionism

Overall coaching effectiveness score: 7/10
The coach effectively identified the core challenge and used thought-provoking questions to shift Michael's perspective. However, the conversation could have gone deeper into underlying fears and ended with a stronger call-to-action.

## Conversation Transcript
```
Michael: I need to pick the most important problem to solve today. I have a few options but want to make sure I choose the right one.

Coach: I notice we're back at the start, Michael - which tells me something important. Let's get radically honest: what's the scariest option on your list that you keep avoiding by "thinking more"?

Michael: You're right that I need to pick a problem, but I'd rather not begin if I can't do it perfectly. I know I need to pick something, but I want to make sure I have the right conditions first.

Coach: Michael, this feels less about "right conditions" and more about fear of imperfection. What small, messy action could you take in the next 10 minutes that would move you forward, even if it's not perfect?

Michael: I know I need to pick something today, but I'll tackle it when I have proper time to do it right. I know I need to pick something, but I want to make sure I have the right conditions first.

Coach: Michael, I'm noticing a pattern - you'll never feel you have "proper time" or "right conditions." What's the real truth: are you waiting for perfect conditions, or avoiding something uncomfortable?

Michael: I understand I need to choose something today, but maybe tomorrow when I'm more prepared. I agree I should choose, but I'd rather wait than risk picking something that's a complete waste.

Coach: Ah, there it is - the fear of wasting time. But here's the irony, Michael: by waiting for "perfect preparation," you're guaranteeing today will be wasted. What's one tiny action you could take right now?
