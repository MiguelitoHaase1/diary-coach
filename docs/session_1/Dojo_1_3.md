# Dojo 1.3: Test-Driven Development for Quality Systems

**Purpose**: Act as my Socratic learning coach to help me understand Test-Driven Development (TDD) as a quality assurance strategy, specifically how writing failing tests first creates better software architecture and why this approach is particularly powerful for AI systems.

## Context: What We Just Built
We just implemented a `ResponseRelevanceMetric` that scores coaching conversation quality. But here's what might be confusing: we wrote the test BEFORE we built the actual scoring algorithm. The test expected a score > 0.7 for "good" coaching responses, but we had no idea if our algorithm could achieve that.

Our first attempt failed miserably (scored 0.25), so we had to debug and refactor our keyword matching approach until it passed. This felt inefficient - why not just build the algorithm first, then test it?

## The Challenge: Why Start with Failing Tests?
This increment revealed something counterintuitive about quality systems: **the requirements themselves are often unclear until you try to measure them**. 

When I said "build a relevance metric," what did that actually mean? Relevant to whom? Scored how? What constitutes "good enough"? The failing test forced us to answer these questions concretely.

## Core Concept: TDD as a Design Philosophy

Test-Driven Development isn't just about testing - it's about **designing systems through their interfaces first**. When you write `assert score > 0.7`, you're making architectural decisions:

1. **Interface Design**: The metric returns a float between 0-1
2. **Quality Standards**: 0.7 is our threshold for "good enough"
3. **Behavior Specification**: Coaching responses should score higher than generic responses
4. **Integration Requirements**: It must work asynchronously (for future LLM calls)

The failing test becomes a **specification document** that guides implementation decisions.

## Why This Matters for You as a PM Who Codes

As a product manager, you're constantly defining "good enough" for features. TDD forces you to translate vague requirements ("make responses more relevant") into measurable criteria ("score > 0.7 for coaching contexts").

This is especially critical for AI systems because:
- **AI outputs are inherently variable** - you need quality gates
- **Evaluation metrics define product quality** - not just user feedback
- **Edge cases emerge during testing** - not during implementation

## Meta-Question for Deep Learning

**How does writing failing tests first change the way you think about building AI products?**

Consider this: if you had to write a failing test for "good coaching conversation" before building any AI coach, what would that test look like? What would it force you to define about your product vision?
