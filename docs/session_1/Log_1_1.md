# Claude Log - Session 1

**Purpose:** To log the specific actions taken during the session, so we capture what has already been tried and stop going down the same rabbit hole several times.

* **Action 1:** Created .env.example template file with comprehensive environment variable structure
    * **Detail:** Generated a template file containing database configuration, API keys, authentication secrets, application settings, external services, logging configuration, and feature flags. This provides a blueprint for all necessary environment variables the diary-coach application will need.

* **Action 2:** Created secure .env file with proper permissions
    * **Detail:** Copied the .env.example template to create the actual .env file and set file permissions to 600 (owner read/write only) using chmod. This ensures sensitive configuration data is only accessible to the file owner.

* **Action 3:** Verified .env file is properly excluded from version control
    * **Detail:** Confirmed that .gitignore already contains entries for .env, .env.local, .env.production, and .env.test files, ensuring no sensitive environment variables will be accidentally committed to the repository.
