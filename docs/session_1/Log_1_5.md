# Session 1, Increment 5: Basic Coach Agent Implementation

**Date**: June 27, 2025  
**Duration**: ~15 minutes  
**Goal**: Implement BaseAgent class with process_message functionality

## Actions Taken

### 1. Test-First Development
- Created `tests/agents/test_base_agent.py` following TDD approach
- Wrote test for agent response to user messages
- Test validates AgentResponse structure and content generation

### 2. BaseAgent Implementation
- Created `src/agents/base.py` with abstract BaseAgent class
- Implemented `process_message` method returning proper AgentResponse
- Added simple content generation logic based on message keywords
- Handled schema compatibility with existing AgentResponse fields

### 3. Module Integration
- Updated `src/agents/__init__.py` to export BaseAgent
- Ensured proper imports and module structure

### 4. Schema Compatibility Fix
- Discovered AgentResponse requires `response_to` field (message ID)
- Updated BaseAgent to properly populate all required schema fields
- Fixed test to include required `timestamp` field for UserMessage

### 5. Testing and Validation
- Set up Python virtual environment for isolated dependencies
- Installed pytest and pytest-asyncio
- Successfully ran individual test and full test suite
- All 8 tests passing (100% success rate)

## Key Technical Decisions

### Agent Response Generation
```python
async def _generate_response(self, user_message: UserMessage) -> str:
    # Simple mock response for base implementation
    if "goals" in user_message.content.lower():
        return "What specific goals would you like to focus on today?"
    elif "productive" in user_message.content.lower():
        return "Tell me more about what productivity means to you."
    else:
        return "I'm here to help you reflect on that. Can you tell me more?"
```

**Rationale**: Started with keyword-based responses for simplicity. This provides testable behavior while keeping the base class focused on infrastructure rather than intelligent conversation.

### Schema Adherence
- Ensured BaseAgent correctly implements AgentResponse schema
- Used proper field mapping: `response_to` links to `user_message.message_id`
- Maintained conversation threading through `conversation_id`

## Outcomes

### âœ… Success Criteria Met
- BaseAgent class successfully processes UserMessage objects
- Returns properly structured AgentResponse objects
- Test passes with expected agent name and non-empty content
- All existing tests continue to pass (no regressions)

### ðŸ”§ Technical Learnings
- **Schema Evolution**: Discovered the importance of field compatibility when integrating new components with existing schemas
- **Virtual Environment**: Confirmed proper Python environment isolation for dependency management
- **TDD Validation**: Test-first approach caught schema mismatches early

## Next Steps
- **Increment 1.6**: Implement stream buffer for dual-track conversations
- **Increment 1.7**: Add Redis integration for distributed event bus
