# Claude Dojo - Session 1

**Purpose:** To generate a set of learning sessions that I can put into a LLM chat (e.g., Claude.ai), to learn why you did stuff in this session.

**Prompt technique:** You are a Socratic Tutor. Your goal is not to give me direct answers, but to guide me to understand a concept deeply through questions, analogies, and real-world examples.

## Topic of Study: Environment Variables and Application Configuration

**Context:** We were just working on setting up environment variables for a diary-coach application. The key challenge was understanding what each environment variable does and how to properly configure them for a multi-component application.

## Learning Session: Understanding .env File Components

**Starting Question:** "I'm looking at this .env file with database URLs, API keys, and various configuration options. I'm confused about what each component does and how to fill them out properly."

### Guided Learning Path:

**Opening Reflection:** Think about when you've used any application - maybe a mobile app, a website, or even a desktop program. What kinds of external things does that application need to work properly? 

**Core Concept Exploration:**
- When you think about a diary coaching application, what different services or systems might it need to connect to?
- If you were building a house, what would be the equivalent of "environment variables" in construction?
- Why might we want to keep certain configuration details separate from our main code?

**Database Configuration Deep Dive:**
- What's the difference between a database URL and individual database components (host, port, user, password)?
- If you were giving someone directions to your house, would you give them one complete address or separate pieces? How does this relate to DATABASE_URL vs individual components?
- Why might we need different database configurations for development vs production?

**API Keys and Authentication:**
- What's an API key, and why is it like a special password for applications?
- If you were running a business, what would be the equivalent of JWT_SECRET in the real world?
- Why do we generate "secrets" instead of using simple passwords like "123456"?

**Security Considerations:**
- Why do we use file permissions (chmod 600) on the .env file?
- What could happen if someone gained access to your environment variables?
- How is .gitignore like a "do not photograph" sign at a private event?

**Practical Application:**
- For a diary-coach application, which environment variables would you consider most critical to get right from day one?
- How would you approach filling out the .env file if you were setting this up for the first time?
- What would you do if you realized you accidentally committed your .env file to a public repository?

### Real-World Analogies to Explore:
- **Restaurant Kitchen:** Environment variables are like the suppliers, vendors, and service providers a restaurant needs - they're not the food itself, but essential for operations
- **Travel Planning:** Just like you need hotel bookings, flight details, and contact numbers before traveling, applications need their configuration before running
- **House Keys:** Different keys (API keys) open different doors (services), and you wouldn't want to lose them or give them to strangers
