   - [ ] Verify ElevenLabs keys are set

2. **LiveKit Knowledge**:
   - [ ] Gather LiveKit error logs
   - [ ] Collect working implementation code
   - [ ] Run knowledge organizer script
   - [ ] Add solutions to expert prompt

3. **Environment Validation**:
   - [ ] Run `python scripts/dev_environment.py status`
   - [ ] Address any missing components
   - [ ] Test each tool individually

### Development Ready For
