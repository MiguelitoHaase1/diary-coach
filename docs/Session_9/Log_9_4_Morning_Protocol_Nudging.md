# Session 9.4: Morning Protocol Nudging System

## Overview
Implemented a dynamic nudging system to ensure the morning coach follows the protocol states defined in the markdown file.

## Problem Identified
The morning coach wasn't following the structured protocol despite having clear instructions in `coach_morning_protocol.md`. The LLM would often skip steps or get stuck in one phase.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Protocol State Parser
Created `protocol_state_parser.py` that:
- Dynamically parses the morning protocol markdown at initialization
- Extracts states, transition triggers, and completion indicators
- Generates appropriate nudges for state transitions
- Ensures the markdown file is the single source of truth

### 2. Morning Protocol Tracker
Built `morning_protocol_tracker.py` that:
- Tracks current conversation state (0-5)
- Detects when state objectives are completed via keyword matching
- Counts exchanges per state to prevent getting stuck
- Generates contextual nudges when needed

### 3. Integration with Enhanced Coach
Modified the coach to:
- Enter morning mode when detecting greetings
- Call the protocol tracker after each exchange
- Store nudges for the next turn
- Inject nudges into the system prompt

## Technical Details

### Performance
- Nudge analysis: <0.5ms per exchange
- Protocol parsing: <1ms at startup
- Zero noticeable impact on response time

### State Detection Logic
- **Primary method**: Keyword detection (e.g., "need to", "problem is" for State 1)
- **Fallback method**: Exchange counting (nudge after 3+ exchanges in same state)
- **Context awareness**: Tracks who said what (problems from user, crux from coach)

### Nudge Delivery
Nudges are injected as `[NUDGE: ...]` hints in the system prompt, invisible to users but guiding the LLM.

## Tests Created
Comprehensive test suite in `test_morning_protocol_nudging.py`:
- Performance tests (speed verification)
- Integration tests (nudge delivery)
- Unit tests (state transitions)
- All tests passing âœ…

## Results
The morning coach now:
1. Reliably follows the 5-state protocol
2. Transitions between states at appropriate times
3. Receives gentle nudges when stuck
4. Maintains natural conversation flow

## Learning Opportunities
- Dynamic prompt engineering can effectively guide LLM behavior
- Lightweight procedural logic (<1ms) can enhance LLM conversations
- Parsing configuration from markdown ensures consistency
- Hybrid approaches (prompt + logic) can be more robust than pure prompting
