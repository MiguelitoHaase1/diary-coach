# Log: Post-Session 9 Documentation Cleanup

**Date**: July 28, 2025
**Duration**: ~10 minutes
**Purpose**: Clean up obsolete documentation files after Session 9 completion

## Overview

After completing Session 9's comprehensive development tooling setup, identified and removed obsolete documentation files that were no longer relevant to the current multi-agent architecture.

## Files Removed

### 1. `docs/OldDeepThoughtsPrompt.md`
- **Reason**: Obsolete prompt template from earlier sessions
- **Replaced By**: Multi-agent Deep Thoughts generation in Session 8
- **Status**: Deleted

### 2. `docs/VibeCodingManifesto`
- **Reason**: Duplicate file without .md extension
- **Kept**: `docs/VibeCodingManifesto.md` (proper markdown file)
- **Status**: Deleted duplicate

## Files Modified

### 1. `context7` (submodule)
- **Status**: Marked as dirty (uncommitted changes)
- **Action**: No action taken - appears to be submodule tracking change

## New Directories

### 1. `.claude/`
- **Purpose**: Claude Code configuration directory
- **Status**: Added to git tracking (untracked)
- **Contents**: Claude-specific settings and configurations

## Rationale for Changes

1. **Old Deep Thoughts Prompt**: The original Deep Thoughts prompt has been completely replaced by the multi-agent system implemented in Session 8. The Reporter and Evaluator agents now handle Deep Thoughts generation with much more sophisticated prompts.

2. **VibeCodingManifesto Duplicate**: Having two versions of the same file (with and without .md extension) was confusing. Kept the properly formatted markdown version.

3. **Clean Architecture Principle**: Following CLAUDE.md's "Clean Architecture Transitions" principle - removing obsolete code and documentation to maintain a clean codebase.

## Impact

- No functional changes to the system
- Improved documentation clarity
- Reduced confusion from duplicate/obsolete files
- Follows best practices for clean codebase maintenance

## Next Steps

- Commit these cleanup changes with appropriate message
- Continue with Session 10 planning or feature development in worktrees
