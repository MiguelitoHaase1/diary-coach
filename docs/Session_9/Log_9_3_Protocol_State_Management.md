# Log 9.3: Protocol State Management Implementation

## Date: 2025-07-28

## Overview
Implemented adaptive protocol state management for the morning ritual coach to properly progress through conversation steps.

## Problem Identified
The morning protocol wasn't progressing past steps 1-2 (problem identification and crux understanding) because the entire protocol was given to the LLM at once with no state tracking.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added "report" Command Enhancement
- Users can now say "report" or "deep report" to end conversation and generate evaluation
- Single command replaces the two-step process (stop, then deep report)
- CLI exits cleanly after report generation

### 2. Protocol State Management (Initial)
Added basic state tracking to coach agent:
- `protocol_step`: Tracks current step (0-5)
- `crux_identified`: Boolean for progression logic
- `problem_statement`: Stores user's identified problem
- Step-specific prompts shown to LLM
- Automatic progression based on message count and content triggers

### 3. Dynamic Protocol Parser (Final Solution)
Created adaptive system that parses protocol from markdown:
- `ProtocolParser` class extracts steps from markdown headers
- Detects `## N: Title` format automatically
- Captures metadata (style guidelines, ending guidance)
- Smart trigger detection from step content
- No hardcoded step count or content

## Key Components

### ProtocolParser (`src/agents/protocol_parser.py`)
- `ProtocolStep` class: Represents individual steps with triggers
- `parse_protocol()`: Extracts steps and metadata from markdown
- `format_step_prompt()`: Formats steps with context variables

### Enhanced Coach Updates
- `_load_protocol()`: Parses protocol on initialization
- `_get_protocol_step_prompt()`: Uses dynamic steps instead of hardcoded
- `_should_progress_protocol()`: Checks dynamic triggers
- Protocol step shown in CLI: `[Protocol Step X/Y]`

## Benefits
1. **Flexibility**: Add/remove/reorder steps in markdown without code changes
2. **Maintainability**: Protocol logic separated from code
3. **Transparency**: Users see current step progress
4. **Adaptability**: System adapts to any protocol structure

## Testing Notes
- Linting passed for all modified files
- Protocol parser handles various markdown formats
- Step progression triggers work with dynamic content
- CLI shows correct step count based on parsed protocol

## Next Steps
- Monitor conversation flow in production
- Consider adding step-specific timeouts
- Potentially support multiple protocols (evening, weekly, etc.)
