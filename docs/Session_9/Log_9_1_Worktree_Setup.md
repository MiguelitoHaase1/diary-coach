# Session 9.1: Git Worktree Setup for Parallel Development

**Date**: 2025-01-28
**Focus**: Setting up git worktrees for parallel feature development

## Summary

This increment established a git worktree structure to enable parallel development across multiple feature branches. This approach allows simultaneous work on different aspects of the diary coach system without context switching or stashing changes.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Worktree Directory Structure

**Action**: Created organized directory structure for feature worktrees
```bash
mkdir -p worktrees/{voice,langgraph,mcp,ui}
```

**Result**: Clean separation of feature development areas

### 2. Created Feature Branches

**Action**: Established dedicated feature branches for each major development area

**Branches Created**:
- `feature/voice-agent` - Voice integration and audio features
- `feature/langgraph-migration` - LangGraph architecture migration
- `feature/mcp-enhancements` - Model Context Protocol improvements
- `feature/ui-interface` - User interface development

### 3. Set Up Git Worktrees

**Action**: Created worktrees linking directories to feature branches
```bash
git worktree add worktrees/voice feature/voice-agent
git worktree add worktrees/langgraph feature/langgraph-migration
git worktree add worktrees/mcp feature/mcp-enhancements
git worktree add worktrees/ui feature/ui-interface
```

**Result**: Each directory is now an independent working copy

## Technical Details

### Worktree Structure
```
diary-coach/
├── main repository (main branch)
└── worktrees/
    ├── voice/      → feature/voice-agent
    ├── langgraph/  → feature/langgraph-migration
    ├── mcp/        → feature/mcp-enhancements
    └── ui/         → feature/ui-interface
```

### Git Worktree Benefits

1. **Parallel Development**: Work on multiple features simultaneously
2. **No Context Switching**: Each feature has its own working directory
3. **Independent Testing**: Run tests in each worktree without conflicts
4. **Clean Commits**: No need to stash changes when switching features
5. **Dependency Isolation**: Each worktree can have different dependencies installed

### Usage Pattern

```bash
# Work on voice features
cd worktrees/voice
# Make changes, run tests, commit to feature/voice-agent

# Switch to UI work without stashing
cd ../ui
# Make changes, run tests, commit to feature/ui-interface

# Main branch remains clean for hotfixes
cd ../..
# Work on main branch independently
```

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development
- Each developer/agent works in their assigned worktree
- Changes are committed to the feature branch
- No impact on main branch or other features

### 2. Integration
- Features are tested independently in their worktrees
- Pull requests created from feature branches
- Merge to main after review and testing

### 3. Cleanup
- After merging, remove worktree: `git worktree remove worktrees/[name]`
- Delete merged branch: `git branch -d feature/[name]`

## Sub-Agent Integration

This structure aligns with the CLAUDE.md sub-agent approach:

- **UI Agent**: Works in `worktrees/ui`
- **MCP Agent**: Works in `worktrees/mcp`
- **LiveKit Agent**: Can use `worktrees/voice` for real-time features
- **Evaluation Agent**: Can work across worktrees for testing
- **Documentation Agent**: Updates docs in main branch

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Main Clean**: Only stable, tested code in main branch
2. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature branch focuses on one area
3. **Regular Sync**: Periodically merge main into feature branches
4. **Clean History**: Use meaningful commit messages in feature branches
5. **Test Locally**: Run full test suite in worktree before PR

## Next Steps

1. Begin feature development in respective worktrees
2. Set up CI/CD to test feature branches
3. Establish merge criteria for feature branches
4. Document feature-specific setup in each worktree

## Commands Reference

```bash
# List all worktrees
git worktree list

# Add new worktree
git worktree add worktrees/[name] feature/[branch-name]

# Remove worktree
git worktree remove worktrees/[name]

# Prune stale worktree information
git worktree prune
```

## Status

✅ Worktree directory structure created
✅ Feature branches established for all agents
✅ Git worktrees configured and verified
✅ Ready for parallel feature development
