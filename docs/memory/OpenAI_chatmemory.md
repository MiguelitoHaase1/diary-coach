Michael is focused on the principle of 'go slow to go fast' in his coding journey. He is deliberately setting up his coding environment and learning foundational tools like Git to avoid relying on high-abstraction platforms like Lovable, Replit, or V0. His goal is to move beyond black-box prototyping and develop a deeper understanding of software architecture and code modulation.

Michael wants to learn how to code in 30- to 60-minute increments, focusing on a tech stack that includes Python or Node.js for the backend, React for the frontend, and using the Windsurf IDE (recently acquired by OpenAI) along with the terminal for tooling. He aims to balance high-level software design with hands-on coding, starting with GenAI tools and then diving deeper into the code, maintaining a composable architecture and solid software design principles.

Michael wants to build a GenAI chatbot similar to the one we have now, with relatively low latency. The chatbot will rely on an underlying dataset that he can update, ideally using an MCP (Model Control Panel) to manage updates. This agentic chatbot will be for personal use, allowing him to adapt and learn from the development process.

Michael wants to remember the leadership style he embodied during a successful CTD IT presentation as 'calm clarity with open energy.' This approach included inclusive listening, engaging presentation style, and a strong contrast to a more rigid or draining format, which resonated deeply with both his team and others.

Michael is reflecting on the key ideas from the 'Product Sense' course, which emphasizes that the quality of thinking matters more than tools or process. The course encourages building a mental model through repeated practice and cognitive empathy, especially by understanding customer motivation. Michael wants to be coached through these reflections with one question at a time.

Michael had a good day working from home, spent time outside and with his kids, and felt positive about the first two hours of his meeting. He felt like a thought leader and aims to be braver moving forward.

Michael wants a customized GPT for a daily morning and evening diary. In the morning, he wants to set one goal that defines success for the day. In the evening, he wants to capture one narrative or story that vividly depicts the day, focusing on memorable moments. He also wants to reflect on the aspired moment from the morning and see if it was achieved or if something else stood out.

Michael wants the customized GPT to adapt its morning and evening prompts dynamically based on his past entries and goals. He prefers a more conversational approach that references previous days' activities and intentions, focusing on setting a daily goal in the morning and capturing a narrative or story in the evening.

Michael wants the customized GPT to provide unique, context-aware prompts each morning and evening, reflecting his past interactions, current intentions, and goals, creating a personalized and engaging experience that feels like a conversation with a friend.

Michael's personal assistant is highly structured, detail-oriented, and a natural problem solver. They have a complementary 'yin-yang' relationship: she brings structure while Michael is innovative. She clearly communicates her career goals, performs well, and delivers results. Michael likens her to 'The Wolf' from Pulp Fiction, who efficiently fixes problems.

Michael is concerned about potential challenges now that his personal assistant is leaving.

Michael wants to emphasize that the new venture model aims to reduce risk and increase quality by ensuring a higher cadence and faster adaptation in digital product development. This approach will still comply with internal SOPs and QMSs, but will not be constrained by the internal consensus culture and the slower development speed typical of drug-focused processes. The goal is to take less risk, not more, by moving faster.

Michael is preparing for an annual performance review with his boss. He is working on a 2x2 performance matrix with 'plus' and 'minus' on the x-axis and 'performance' and 'behavior' on the y-axis. The top right quadrant represents 'plus' for performance, and the bottom left represents 'minus' for performance, etc. He prefers a step-by-step conversation to build this matrix and wants to discuss this matrix in a conversation tomorrow, filling out sentences for each quadrant.

Michael's employee has shown high performance by maintaining composure in a challenging product team setup and embracing changes that empower developers. He has also advocated strongly with stakeholders regarding feature decisions. Additionally, the employee demonstrated strong behavior by stepping in with meticulous planning when the project manager didn't fulfill their role. He showed calmness and pragmatism, maintaining composure and being hands-on despite challenging circumstances. Michael's employee likely has a strong sense of responsibility and dedication to the team, as well as valuing thorough planning and structure.

Michael noted that his employee demonstrates strong performance and behavior, with key strengths in empowering developers, meticulous planning, advocating for the team, maintaining composure under pressure, and showing resilience. However, he suggests the employee work on finding compromises, adapting to transformative changes, embracing nuance, and avoiding rigid, black-and-white thinking to build better relationships and trust.

Michael wants to define 5-10 principles for product teams in digital product development within a pharmaceutical company, focusing on local decision-making for medical, legal, and regulatory (MLR) constraints, and emphasizing the tech industry's capability to easily build new instances for particular affiliates. This includes adapting visual identity, documentation approach, and creating new endpoints for individual affiliates, with full empowerment for local teams. Additionally, he wants to include a principle about data strategy: HQ decides on outcome-focused data, while commercial data (like churn or onboarding rates) is managed locally.

Michael made significant progress on the Obesity PSS, bringing it to launch and gaining higher attention. He transformed Apollo from an interesting product into a core element of the strategy, achieving execution success with his product manager. Additionally, he built a stellar team of high-performing individuals.

Michael cultivated a positive and opportunity-focused culture within his team, fostering a sense of belonging despite organizational complexity and uncertainty.

Michael notes that he struggled to change the situation for MyoConnect, despite significant efforts through workshops and engagement, and the product remains in an unhealthy environment. He also hasn't managed to close down products like JEDI, MyoConnect, and Cleardose, which he believes are necessary for focusing on fewer successes, resulting in too many reports and complexity.

Michael sees speaking up in the leadership team as good behavior, offering critical views, but he might also be perceived as blending in too much or not making significant changes, potentially appearing more as a complainer rather than a solution provider.

Michael has been thinking ahead, advocating for aspirational ways of working to transform future strategies, but hasn't yet fully implemented these transformative changes at the execution level. He has navigated a significant organizational change, maintaining high energy and a strong product culture despite complexities and challenges for team members.

Michael appreciates Hau's performance strengths, including pushing for a growth-focused mindset in DoseCheck, conducting valuable deep analysis on patient unit value, and being a strong sparring partner in digital transformation with deep engagement and strategic thinking.

Michael noted areas for improvement for Hau: improving written communication to provide a broader view of his work, narrowing down focus and managing difficult stakeholders, finding a compelling GLP-1 experience within DoseCheck by exploring more broadly across the team, and ensuring his communication style is team-oriented and considerate. Michael notes that Hau sometimes comes across as short-handed and fast in communication, which can make him appear more like an individual contributor rather than part of a team. Hau has been successful in engaging senior stakeholders like Peder and Marlene, building trust and proving his worth in front of them and Malkin.

Michael is currently working as head of product in a pharmaceutical company and is considering two job options: starting his own company within healthcare if he decides to focus on this industry long-term, or becoming head of software development at GN Store Nord (GN Group), specifically in the Jabra division for enterprise, for broader experience in product development and digital.

Michael is preparing to discuss the opportunity to join GN Store Nord (GN Group) in the Jabra division as head of product with the CEO. He wants to highlight what excites him about working with the company in its current situation.

Michael is conducting a performance review of a product manager who has been with the company for four months. The product manager has built strong relationships with business owners and is seen as having a strong sense of ownership, focusing on patient and user engagement. He is considered a thought leader and prefers to drive processes himself. However, his presentation skills are lacking, making it hard to understand his direction. He tends to go down rabbit holes and communicate bottom-up, which makes it difficult for Michael to feel confident in his direction. Michael prefers a more hypothesis-driven, top-down communication approach.

Michael values a product manager's ability to take someone else's mental model and work with it, rather than always creating their own. He believes this is important for fostering ownership and collaboration within the team. Michael appreciates a product manager's ability to embrace team collaboration, work closely with designers, business owners, and the insights lead, and incorporate others' ways and thoughts into their work. He values co-creation, engagement, and empowering others to feel a sense of ownership.

Michael values a product manager's empathy and awareness of others' feelings but notes that over-emphasis on others' emotions can sometimes feel invasive or reinforce negative feelings. He prefers a balance that respects boundaries and maintains a professional focus.

He is interested in targeting individuals who are prediabetic or in the early stages of type 2 diabetes, offering a comprehensive solution to potentially reverse or manage the disease before it progresses.

Michael believes that achieving widespread coverage for GLP-1s and the associated regimen for prediabetics is crucial for early intervention in type 2 diabetes. He is considering the realism of this approach in terms of pricing and payer coverage.

Michael is considering the implications of his pharmaceutical company, which historically focuses on diabetes, expanding into the prediabetes space. He recognizes this would be a significant mindset shift, involving moving beyond treatment into early diagnosis and intervention.

Michael prefers slower speech in Spanish conversations when his proficiency might be challenged, but is comfortable with faster speech when conversing with more proficient speakers.

Michael is spending time playing with his kids.

Michael is working on an Opportunity Solution Tree related to side effects management for patients using GLP-1 drugs, specifically focusing on managing nausea and vomiting.

Michael is proposing a new structure for digital product teams as part of a cost-cutting initiative. The new structure involves: 1. Strong tech leads who also take on project management and systems management responsibilities. 2. Strong product managers who also handle project management budgets and tasks typically done by product owners. 3. Line managers (organizational managers) taking a more hands-on, coaching role for developers, designers, and product owners, as individual coaching will decrease due to fewer project managers. 4. Core team structure that always includes a product manager, a tech lead, and a lead designer, with strong managers for developers as well.

Michael believes that line managers overseeing developers, product managers, or designers need to have direct experience in those fields to effectively manage their teams. These managers should have content expertise and not just be generic people managers. This might require different people or additional training to be hands-on managers with deep domain knowledge.

Michael believes that there are already people in place within the organization who fit the hands-on approach for line management. However, some of these individuals are not currently managers but should be, and part of the shift will involve identifying talent that can truly coach in this step.

Michael is thinking about digital health strategies for a pharmaceutical company and has identified four key business outcomes for digital health initiatives: 1. Capturing real-world evidence to complement clinical trial data for payer negotiations or regulator applications. 2. Positioning for a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model as patients behave more like customers, bypassing healthcare professionals (HCPs). 3. Collaborating with health systems to help them scale and deliver clinical-like products as medical devices or DTX (digital therapeutics), possibly to gain preference in partnerships. 4. Increasing patient outcomes directly through DTX or SAMD (Software as a Medical Device) products, complementing doctors. He is seeking feedback to better understand the distinctions between these and to strengthen his strategic thinking around them.

Michael believes DTX and SAMD strategies are not viable due to regulatory hurdles and lack of incentives for doctors to push these tools. He favors a shift toward a more consumer-driven model or other digital tools outside heavy regulatory frameworks. He plans to address this in a memo later.

Michael prefers to use 'they' and 'them' rather than 'he' or 'she.'

Michael's boss is named Thomas.

Michael believes that high travel is essential for product owners in digital product teams in his pharmaceutical company because the make-or-break factor is getting buy-in from affiliates or regions. He believes affiliates need direct engagement with people deeply involved in the product's development. This connection allows both the product and the affiliates to influence each other, making it a 'contact sport' that's even more crucial with affiliates than with therapeutic areas. Affiliates invite product owners to drive conversations on PRB, MLR, go-to-market strategy, and growth tactics because they see the value in product owners being deeply knowledgeable about the product. This close relationship is what differentiates the company from consultancies or external agencies.

Michael has a 1.5-year-old and a 4-year-old child.

Michael is preparing a presentation related to building digital products for the pharmaceutical industry, with a focus on product vice presidents involved in drug development.

Michael is presenting to product vice presidents in a pharmaceutical company who manage the project management around getting drugs to market, with expertise in clinical trials, market launch, and brand building. He is presenting digital product incubation and development suggestions for the brands they work with.

Michael's presentation intro will include a humorous reference to the old saying, 'no plan survives first contact with the enemy,' connecting it to product incubation and strategy. He plans to emphasize the importance of setting up a framework that empowers adaptation when plans meet real-world challenges, rather than focusing on creating a 'perfect plan.'

Michael is interested in understanding NVIDIA's value chain and how their role differs from manufacturers like TSMC.

Michael prefers to answer questions one at a time when having a conversation.

Michael's four key realms of discovery for his digital product incubation teams are: 
1. Real-world evidence creation via digital solutions to address payer needs for outcome-based healthcare models.
2. Real-world data for regulators to approve drugs with specific claims and manage the drug life cycle, including pharmacovigilance.
3. Wearables integration to collect real-world data through CGMs and other devices, helping to advance payer and regulatory efforts.
4. Integrated health systems, where digital products are closely aligned with healthcare providers like Mayo Clinic to track patient outcomes and integrate into their systems.

These four realms form the core of Michael's long-term vision for coordinated digital products.

Michael believes that wearables, particularly CGMs, will become democratized, allowing even pre-patients to use them to track biometric data. He sees wearables companies potentially owning the patient life cycle, making it crucial for pharmaceutical companies to integrate with wearables to maintain relevance and avoid being commoditized. This is broader than just collecting real-world data for regulators and payers; it’s also about staying competitive in the market.

Michael envisions co-developing products with major healthcare providers like Mayo Clinic, where they collaborate to push EHRs and clinical systems to become more user-friendly. He sees it as essential for pharmaceutical companies to invest and partner in these efforts to remain key players in the evolving healthcare system.

Michael is considering setting up product teams with a trio (product manager, tech lead, lead designer) to build digital products for pharmaceutical companies that directly touch patients, HCPs, and payers, focusing particularly on scenarios that research and development teams would invest in rather than leaving it to the commercial part of the organization.

Michael is considering using the phrase 'in the fringes' to describe ideas or developments that are relevant for the digital product team, but not in the short run. These are like bubbles that may become important later on.

Michael is considering whether the phrase 'in the fringes' might sound derogatory when referring to tasks managed by a strategy or program management team, as it could imply diminishment of their importance.

Michael prefers a more collaborative and reflective approach when setting OKRs, where key results focus on the emotional and motivational aspects of the product team that will take over the incubation project. Key themes for him include excitement, humility, empowerment, and clarity. He wants OKRs to reflect more than just product-market fit, focusing on creating the right environment for pivoting, learning, and alignment between product owners and the incubated product.

Michael believes that the clarity of vision, especially around the outcome or the human behavior change to achieve, is the most important factor in making a product owner feel excited when taking over a project. He emphasizes the importance of clearly describing the problem to solve through an opportunity solution tree, with a detailed understanding of the key jobs to be done, based on thorough analysis during the incubation phase.

Michael believes that presenting a variety of prototypes, not just one, as potential solutions to the key jobs to be done is essential to generating excitement in the product owner. This helps them see the possibilities and feel empowered to explore different directions for the product, reinforcing their ownership and flexibility in taking the project forward.

Michael would measure the success of the handover by gathering both qualitative feedback from product owners and seeing if at least 20% of current product owners would want to switch over and take ownership of the incubated product. This combination would serve as a strong indicator of both excitement and product-market fit.

Michael's three-year-old child threw up a few times this morning, but the vomit doesn't smell strongly, indicating it may not be coming from the bottom of the stomach. The child feels fine in between episodes of vomiting.

Michael has a 'play basement' with space for climbing and playing spacious games.

Michael is working on naming a team that defines strategy, where to play and how to win in a particular domain, sets and measures OKRs, tracks weekly progress, and reports back to SteerCos and product review groups in digital. Portfolio Management is one name under consideration.

Michael is working with JavaScript and AI to write a web app and is exploring deployment options as a non-developer.

Michael is focusing on non-functional requirements in his project, particularly aspects like load time and overall performance, and plans to address these with his colleague Cornelius. His email about non-functional requirements is intended for the IT team, who are evaluating whether to use XWeb or another stack for the front-end experience of a product. The feature requirements were created by senior stakeholders, including Cornelius, and now the IT team is assessing the importance of non-functional requirements in making the final decision. Michael aims to emphasize these points in a polite and non-demanding manner in his communication, encouraging a sense of freedom and ownership among his team.

Michael has decided to use the following sections for his weekly status updates to his boss: Gold Stars (wins and successes), Speed Bumps (fixable concerns), Red Alerts (serious issues requiring escalation), Brainwaves (new ideas and concepts), and Radar (upcoming events or potential future risks). He is now seeking advice on how to introduce this format to his boss in the first email, framing it as an experiment to gauge interest and usefulness.

Michael's short-term assignment considerations for employees moving internationally are focused on co-work and regulatory concerns, not related to COVID.

Michael is planning to build a digital product that serves as an architecture enabling other products to be built on top of it. The goal is to create a flexible foundation, allowing individual countries (referred to as affiliates in his company) to develop their own software or front-end experiences related to something called Noble Connect, using whatever tech stack is most convenient for them, including low-code or no-code tools like Webflow. Michael wants to make it clear in the memo that different countries (affiliates) have varying needs and budgets. Some might afford expensive setups like a Salesforce tech stack, while others would prefer using more affordable and iterative low-code or no-code tools like Webflow due to cost constraints. He is also likely to include headless API as a key technology for this architecture. Additionally, Michael wants to include a headless API for the CRM that tracks patient interactions, likely built on top of Salesforce. He also wants to implement a headless CMS (Content Management System) that manages assets for front pages, allowing individual countries to add, delete, whitelist, or blacklist assets, and personalize content for users. Michael wants to include an API for an algorithm that personalizes the front page based on everything known about an individual patient. The architecture should include playbooks for managing MLR (Medical, Legal, Regulatory) and PRB (Pharmaceutical Regulatory Board) processes, as well as a visual identity playbook. The goal is to make it easy to plug in APIs and build custom solutions, while offering a preferred stack that's user-friendly but allowing flexibility for other stacks. Michael wants to ensure that the memo clearly communicates to the tech lead that the goal is to build the foundational 'picks and shovels' while being actively involved in the process. Additionally, for each front-end tool, there should be a whitelist of approved tools, including no-code and low-code options, along with a playbook for navigating risk assessments and compliance. This will help affiliates quickly choose and implement tools while adhering to corporate security and compliance standards. Michael also wants to ensure that the tech lead understands they will be working in a trio alongside a product owner and a lead designer on this project. The design lead will focus on creating a visual identity and guidance for implementing the architecture in different regions, ensuring affiliates have robust support and are not left to work entirely on their own. The overarching framing of the memo should emphasize that while regions are encouraged to build their own solutions tailored to their needs, they should do so by 'standing on the shoulders of giants' in terms of architecture, design, and guidance.

Michael wants to ensure that there is a centralized data capture architecture across regions, allowing for the collection of patient behavior data, even with diverse front-end experiences. This centralized data architecture should inform future personalization and experiences, and it falls within the scope for the tech lead to manage.

Michael is currently in Møn, Denmark.

Michael wants to implement a methodology in his team focused on myth-busting in digital product development. This involves challenging assumptions related to desirability (user wants), usability (user life integration), viability (business value), and feasibility (technical possibility), with a particular emphasis on desirability and viability.

Michael plans to implement a performance management system focusing on the number of assumptions surfaced, tested, and either validated or rejected. The key metric will be the 'number of mythbusters.' The process will involve using Strategizer's test cards, monthly team sessions to review test cards, weekly deep dives, one-on-ones to track progress, and a monthly celebration of the most successful tests to showcase and celebrate best practices.

Michael believes that most digital ideas, even if they sound good, are actually wrong about 95% of the time. This mental model will be trained into individuals and teams, as well as senior stakeholders. The goal is to prove the value of testing assumptions by focusing on a few key areas, demonstrating, and showcasing the results.

Michael plans to focus on initial areas for demonstrating the value of the new myth-busting approach within their incubation processes, patient-centered solutions, and building products and APIs for partners.

Michael believes that implementing this methodology is the best way to introduce product thinking to senior stakeholders by showing concrete assumption testing. He anticipates potential resistance from those strongly attached to their assumptions and recognizes the need for political backing. He plans to secure support from his superiors and communicate upfront about the importance and necessity of this approach to manage expectations and avoid being perceived as no-sayers.
