# Core Beliefs: A Framework for Product Leadership and Organizational Excellence

This framework represents a comprehensive philosophy for building exceptional products and leading high-performing teams. The core thesis is that sustainable success emerges from three foundational pillars: deep customer understanding drives product decisions, strategic clarity enables focused execution, and human-centered leadership creates the conditions for teams to thrive.

## Product & Customer Insight

### Customer-Centric Product Development
The foundation of exceptional products lies in understanding that customers "hire" products to solve concrete functional, emotional, and social struggles in their lives. This Jobs To Be Done framework drives several key practices:

**Discovery and Validation Principles:**
- **Path dependent software**: Software development is path-dependent; plan thoroughly before V1, as complete pivots are difficult
- **Weekly Customer Interviews**: Conduct weekly customer interviews to maintain constant learning and prevent market drift
- **The Mom test**: Get reliable customer feedback by asking about actual experiences in the past, not hypothetical ones in the future
- **'Switch interviews'**: There is tremendous insight in doing interviews with users who switched to/from your product or competitor's products
- **"Test assumptions, not products"**: It's faster and easier to test concrete assumptions than full products

**Product Definition and Strategy:**
- **What is a 'product'**: A product is defined by its customer focus and value creation, not internal features; it includes a future vision and strategy for users
- **No to target groups/personas**: Group customers by situations, not demographics
- **Story-Driven Product Development**: Develop products around emotionally resonant narratives that connect with user aspirations
- **Product Discovery Framework**: Discovery must address four risks: desirability, usability, feasibility, and business viability

### Product Excellence and Taste
Product quality emerges from relentless focus on customer value and continuous refinement:

- **Product Taste - high ceiling**: There is a MUCH higher ceiling than most believe for how good product taste can be. Keep nurturing taste by trying products, reflecting, and doing user simulations
- **Product is about putting the right 4 things first**: Outcomes>Output, Empowerment>Action, Insight>Execution, Simulation>Procedural Logic
- **Every feature should fight for survival**: Always simplify and subtract - the hidden costs of bloating are huge
- **Prototype to Learn**: Physical prototypes uncover problems that spreadsheets and presentations cannot

### Market Strategy and Growth
Sustainable growth comes from depth before breadth:

- **Market deepening before widening**: Achieve deep problem-solution fit in a niche before expanding market
- **Customer conflicts reveal market segmentation opportunities, not product failures**: When different customer groups request contradictory features, identify underlying jobs-to-be-done and serve your core segment exceptionally well
- **Onboard manually (at first)**: Early in product life, manual 1-1 onboarding frees engineering, builds brand, and fosters user-centric culture
- **Word of Mouth beats virality**: Digital products rarely go truly viral; focus on creating word-of-mouth effects

## Strategy & Vision

### Strategic Thinking Frameworks
Effective strategy requires clear positioning, focused segmentation, and distinctive differentiation:

**Core Strategy Components:**
- **A good strategy has 3 things**: Positioning (job-to-be-done), Segmentation (who to focus on), Differentiation (how to win)
- **The Kernel of Good Strategy**: Effective strategy consists of diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent actions
- **Hedgehog strategy**: Focus on the intersection of what you're best at, what drives your economics, and your passion

**Strategic Adaptation:**
- **Strategic Inflection Points**: Spot 10X shifts in business fundamentals, demanding new strategy
- **Finite vs. Infinite Mindset**: Playing to win vs. playing to continue playing changes strategic approach
- **Wartime vs. Peacetime CEO**: Different leadership styles are needed for crisis (speed, survival) vs. growth (scaling, optimization)

### Technology and Business Decisions
Strategic technology choices should align with business differentiation:

- **Build vs. Buy Decision**: Software differentiating your business should be built, not bought
- **AI makes software design more important**: With AI coding, software design and architecture become key engineering skills
- **Resilience Over Optimization**: Resilient systems prioritize redundancy, diversity, and adaptability over fragile optimization
- **"Let Chaos Reign, Then Rein In Chaos"**: Allow exploration during transitions before focusing execution
- **Theatrical vs. Dramatic**: Finite players follow scripts; infinite players embrace the unknown and play with boundaries

## Mental Models & Decision Making

### Critical Thinking and Problem Solving
Exceptional decisions emerge from rigorous thinking processes that challenge assumptions:

**Fundamental Reasoning:**
- **First Principles Thinking**: Break down problems to fundamental truths and rebuild, avoiding analogy
- **The Crux/leverage point**: Identify the core challenge that, if addressed, unlocks everything else
- **"10X Ceiling Principle"**: Adopt a mindset that no matter how far we are, there's always a 10X improvement possible in quality
- **Single Decisive Reason (SDR)**: Avoid multiple weak reasons; identify one single decisive reason for a decision

**Planning and Forecasting:**
- **Backcasting**: Plan by working backward from the future, not projecting current trends
- **Planning Fallacy**: We underestimate project time, costs, and risks due to optimism and misrepresentation
- **Reference Class Forecasting**: Improve estimates using historical data from similar projects

### Decision Quality and Validation
Superior decisions require multiple perspectives and continuous validation:

- **Experts simulate precisely**: Experts use pattern recognition and mental simulations for quick decisions within their domain of expertise
- **Triangulate all data driven conclusions**: Complement quantitative data with diverse qualitative data points
- **Strong Opinions, Weakly Held**: Each perspective is a hypothesis awaiting validation through deeper engagement with reality
- **WAYRTTD**: "What Are You Really Trying To Do" is a powerful coaching question to uncover outcomes and assumptions
- **Write it Down**: Thoughts, hypotheses, and decisions should be written down and broadly shared

## Leadership & Team Dynamics

### Trust and Communication
High-performing teams are built on psychological safety and radical candor:

**Building Trust:**
- **Trust as Vulnerability**: Foundational trust requires willingness to be vulnerable and admit limitations
- **"Care Personally, Challenge Directly"**: Radical candor balances personal connection with direct feedback
- **Mutual Purpose**: Establish a shared goal before addressing difficult topics
- **"Getting to 'No'"**: Allowing "no" gives control, fostering collaboration

**Effective Communication:**
- **Calibrated Questions**: Use "how" and "what" questions to guide collaborative problem-solving
- **The AWE Question**: "And what else?" uncovers further insights and prevents premature solutions in coaching
- **Mastering Stories**: Separate facts from interpretations to understand and control emotions before speaking
- **Gossip is toxic**: Gossip is violence and toxic. Deflect when you hear it, or turn it into curiosity by bringing a positive spin

### Team Performance and Development
Teams excel when individual capabilities align with collective outcomes:

**Management Philosophy:**
- **Task-Relevant Maturity**: Match management style to team member's task experience, not overall competence
- **Developer As Innovator**: Treat developers as creative problem-solvers, connecting them to business outcomes
- **Lead via context**: Create transparency and push decision authority to the lowest appropriate level
- **Managers look for Leverage**: Managers should focus on high-leverage activities affecting many, not individual contributor work

**Team Dynamics:**
- **Five Dysfunctions Model**: Teams fail from lack of trust, fear of conflict, no commitment, no accountability, or inattention to results
- **The Braintrust**: Regular, non-hierarchical peer reviews focus on work, not people
- **"First who, then what"**: Prioritize getting the right people in place before defining vision/strategy
- **No to RACI**: RACI views hinder collaboration by creating silos; shared understanding is key

### Conflict Resolution and Collaboration
Productive conflict resolution requires understanding root causes and creating space for multiple approaches:

- **Disagreement often signals missing information, not opposing values**: Systematically identify what information each party has that others lack
- **Some conflicts require temporary separation, not forced resolution**: Create parallel paths to test competing approaches rather than forcing premature consensus
- **Work on Others' Emotions**: Influence effectively by appealing to emotions, as decisions are primarily emotional
- **Asynchronous Over Meetings**: When a meeting can be asynchronous, prefer discussion papers and Loom recordings
- **Be a bar raiser on quality**: Most leaders focus on timelines and speed; prefer to be a bar raiser on product quality and craftsmanship

## Execution & Operations

### Performance Measurement and Optimization
Exceptional execution requires focusing on outcomes while maintaining system health:

**Key Metrics:**
- **DORA Metrics**: Key product team metrics: deployment frequency, lead time, mean time to restore, change failure rate
- **10 Experiments per week**: Strong product teams run 10-20 weekly experiments to invalidate assumptions
- **Outcome vs. Output**: Measure teams by business outcomes, not features or velocity

**System Design:**
- **API-First Strategy**: Build software with composable APIs first for flexibility and reuse
- **Empower the front**: Great outcomes come from consistency in countless small decisions made by people in context

### Execution Rhythm and Sustainability
Sustainable high performance requires deliberate rhythm and recovery protocols:

**Execution Principles:**
- **Execution requires rhythm, not just intention**: Create consistent problem-solving cycles where teams identify key problems and reconvene to discuss progress
- **Accelerate execution by compressing feedback cycles**: Increase cadence speed by an order of magnitude; default to "How about we meet in 2 hours?" rather than waiting
- **Move slow to go fast**: True long-term velocity comes from deliberate pauses, strategic reflection, and the courage to slow down

**Human-Centered Operations:**
- **Follow-up should be human and specific, not systematized and procedural**: Ask tailored questions about specific challenges rather than cookie-cutter status checks
- **Recovery protocols are as important as performance protocols**: Build explicit practices for recognizing cognitive overload and create predetermined responses for stepping back

## Personal Growth & Mindset

### Leadership Consciousness and Responsibility
Exceptional leaders operate from awareness and take complete ownership of their contributions:

- **Above vs. Below the Line**: Leaders recognize and choose responses from open/curious vs. closed/defensive states
- **The Observer Self**: You are the awareness watching your thoughts, enabling choice in responses
- **Radical Responsibility**: Leaders own their contributions to all circumstances, eliminating blame
- **The Path of Surrender**: Accepting life's flow rather than resisting leads to growth and resilience

### Continuous Learning and Growth
Personal excellence emerges from maintaining beginner's mind and prioritizing learning over being right:

- **Cultivate Beginner's Mind**: Approach creative work with fresh eyes and curiosity, questioning assumptions
- **Learning Over Being Right**: Value curiosity and growth over defending positions; treat all criticism as valuable data
- **Notice story moments**: Train attention to detail, empathy, and storytelling by noticing and recording concrete moments that seem significant
