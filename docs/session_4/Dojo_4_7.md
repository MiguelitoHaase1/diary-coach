# Dojo Session 4.7

**Purpose**: Enable me to copy a learning theme into Claude.ai, so I can personally prompt it further to teach me more about it.

**Context**: While implementing a 3-tier evaluation system for our diary coach, we built a sophisticated architecture for managing different LLM services based on cost and capability requirements. This involved creating factory patterns, service abstractions, and strategic model selection for different use cases.

**Challenge**: How to balance cost-effectiveness with quality in AI system evaluation. We needed frequent, cheap testing for development cycles while maintaining high-quality analysis for important evaluations.

**Concept**: **Strategic AI Model Tiering Architecture** - The principle of matching AI model capabilities and costs to specific use cases. Rather than using expensive models for everything or cheap models that compromise quality, create a systematic approach where:
- Development/testing uses cost-effective models (GPT-4o-mini)
- Regular operations use balanced models (Claude Sonnet)  
- Critical analysis uses premium models (Claude Opus)

This matters beyond this specific use case because as AI becomes central to more systems, cost optimization through intelligent model selection becomes crucial for scalable AI applications. The factory pattern enables easy switching and the tiered approach provides a framework for making these decisions systematically.

**Other areas one could explore**: 
1. **AI Cost Optimization Strategies** - Advanced techniques for reducing AI inference costs while maintaining quality
2. **LLM Service Architecture Patterns** - Design patterns for building robust, scalable AI service integrations
3. **Evaluation-Driven Development** - Using AI evaluations as a core part of the development feedback loop
