## Test Results

**Total Tests**: 39 tests across 5 test files
**Success Rate**: 100% passing
**Coverage**: All major functionality paths tested

### Test Categories
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and data flow
- **Performance Tests**: Caching, budget management, optimization
- **Edge Cases**: Error handling, empty data, malformed inputs

## Key Lessons Learned

### Pattern-Based Detection
- Regular expressions powerful for memory query detection
- Flexible patterns needed to handle natural language variations
- Important to distinguish memory queries from regular coaching requests

### Context Budget Management
- Critical for maintaining performance at scale
- Smart truncation preserves most important information
- Budget allocation prevents context overflow

### Document Integration
- Chunking essential for large documents (37K+ characters)
- Cache hit tracking needed careful implementation
- User-specified document paths increase flexibility

### Memory Persistence
- Conversation history summarization enables long-term memory
- Relevance scoring essential for efficient retrieval
- Privacy controls necessary for sensitive conversations

## Architecture Summary

```
User Message → Context Relevance Scorer → Memory Recall Detection
                                      ↓
                            [Memory Query?] → Memory Recall Node → Coach
                                      ↓
                              [Regular Query] → Todo Context → Document Context → Conversation Memory → Coach
```

The diary coach now has full personal context integration capabilities, making coaching conversations more personalized, contextual, and effective.
