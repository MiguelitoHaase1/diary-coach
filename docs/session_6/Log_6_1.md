# Session 6.1 Log: Context Node Architecture

**Date**: July 5, 2025  
**Duration**: 30 minutes  
**Increment**: 6.1 - Context Node Architecture Foundation

## Objective
Create the foundational context-aware graph structure with LangGraph nodes that can be conditionally executed based on conversation relevance.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Test-First Development
- Created comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_context_aware_graph.py`
- Defined 4 core test scenarios:
  - Graph structure validation (nodes exist)
  - Conditional execution based on relevance
  - State channels for context data
  - Fallback behavior when context disabled

### 2. Context State Architecture
- Created `src/orchestration/context_state.py` to avoid circular imports
- Defined `ContextState` dataclass with:
  - Core conversation data (messages, conversation_id)
  - Context data channels (todo_context, document_context, conversation_history)
  - Relevance scoring and usage tracking
  - Decision path for debugging

### 3. LangGraph Implementation
- Built `src/orchestration/context_graph.py` with:
  - `ContextRelevanceScorer` for basic keyword-based scoring
  - `TodoContextNode`, `DocumentContextNode`, `ConversationMemoryNode` (mock implementations)
  - `ContextAwareCoach` for response generation
  - Conditional routing based on relevance thresholds

### 4. Graph Composition
- Connected nodes with conditional edges
- Implemented threshold-based context fetching (>0.6 relevance)
- Sequential context loading when enabled
- Proper START/END node connections

## Technical Decisions

### State Management
- Used dataclass with `field(default_factory=dict)` for mutable defaults
- Separated context data into dedicated channels
- Added decision tracking for debugging graph execution

### Conditional Routing
- Simple threshold-based routing (will be enhanced in later increments)
- `should_fetch_context()` function for edge conditions
- Graceful degradation when context disabled

### Mock Implementations
- Basic mock data for testing without external dependencies
- Keyword-based relevance scoring as foundation
- Placeholder coach responses to validate flow

## Test Results
```bash
tests/test_context_aware_graph.py::test_context_aware_graph_structure PASSED
tests/test_context_aware_graph.py::test_context_node_conditional_execution PASSED  
tests/test_context_aware_graph.py::test_context_state_channels PASSED
tests/test_context_aware_graph.py::test_context_disabled_fallback PASSED
```

## Key Learning: Graph State Architecture
Understanding LangGraph's state management was crucial. The key insight was that state flows through all nodes, and each node can read and modify the shared state object. This enables powerful orchestration patterns while maintaining type safety.

## Next Steps
- Increment 6.2: Replace mock todo node with real MCP integration
- Enhance relevance scoring beyond simple keywords
- Add performance monitoring for context fetching

## Files Created
- `src/orchestration/context_state.py` - Shared state definition
- `src/orchestration/context_graph.py` - LangGraph implementation  
- `tests/test_context_aware_graph.py` - Comprehensive test suite

## Challenges Overcome
- **Circular Import**: Resolved by extracting `ContextState` to separate module
- **State Typing**: Ensured type safety across all graph nodes
- **Conditional Routing**: Implemented clean threshold-based edge conditions
