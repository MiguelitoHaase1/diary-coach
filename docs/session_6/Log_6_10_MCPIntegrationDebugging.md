# Session 6.10 Log: MCP Integration Debugging - Issue Persists

**Date**: July 5, 2025  
**Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Objective**: Debug why coach continues hallucinating todos despite real MCP integration  
**Status**: ❌ UNRESOLVED - Coach still hallucinating despite technical integration working

## Problem Statement

User reported that the coach is still hallucinating todos (mentioning "Identify key problems to solve in 2025", "Draft strategic plan for Stealth", etc.) instead of referencing actual Todoist tasks focused on meditation, deep learning, and code fixes.

## Investigation Findings

### ✅ MCP Integration Layer Working
- **Real API Connection**: Successfully connected to Todoist with 108 todos
- **Data Fetching**: Can retrieve actual todos like "køb camping gear" and "planlæg vejfest"
- **Filtering Logic**: Context-aware filtering based on conversation keywords functional
- **Error Handling**: Robust fallback mechanisms in place

### ❌ Coach System Integration Broken
- **Root Cause**: Main coach system (`src/main.py`) uses old architecture without context integration
- **Context Graph**: Built context-aware LangGraph system but never connected to main entry point
- **Coach Agent**: Updated `DiaryCoach` class with MCP integration, but CLI may have issues

## Technical Work Attempted

### 1. Updated MCP Todo Node (✅ Working)
```python
# src/orchestration/mcp_todo_node.py
- Replaced mock data with real Todoist API calls
- Added multi-source token discovery
- Implemented proper pagination handling
- Added robust error handling with fallback
```

### 2. Fixed Context Graph (✅ Working)
```python
# src/orchestration/context_graph.py
class TodoContextNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.mcp_todo_node = MCPTodoNode()  # Real integration
```

### 3. Enhanced Coach Agent (✅ Working)
```python
# src/agents/coach_agent.py
- Added MCP integration to DiaryCoach.__init__()
- Implemented _get_todo_context() method
- Added _get_system_prompt_with_context() for real todo injection
- Smart keyword-based relevance scoring
```

### 4. Verification Testing (✅ Working)
```
=== Real Todos Found ===
1. køb camping gear - high priority (Due: 2025-07-14)
2. planlæg vejfest - high priority (Due: 2025-07-06)
✅ Real todos are being fetched successfully!
```

## Outstanding Issues

### 1. System Architecture Gap
- **Problem**: Context-aware LangGraph system exists but isn't used by main entry point
- **Current**: `src/main.py` → `DiaryCoach` → basic LLM calls
- **Missing**: Integration with context-aware system that includes todo fetching

### 2. CLI Integration Problems
- **Issue**: CLI gets stuck in infinite loop during testing
- **Symptom**: "Error: EOF when reading a line" repeated endlessly
- **Impact**: Cannot test full system integration in practice

### 3. Prompt Integration Unclear
- **Question**: Are real todos actually being injected into the system prompt?
- **Uncertainty**: LLM calls may be timing out before todo context is included
- **Testing Gap**: No verification that enhanced prompts reach the LLM

### 4. Context Triggering Logic
- **Current**: Keywords like "prioritize", "task", "today" trigger todo fetching
- **Issue**: May not trigger for conversational references to priorities
- **Example**: "What should I focus on?" might not match keyword patterns

## Failed Debugging Attempts

1. **Direct Coach Testing**: LLM calls timed out after 2 minutes
2. **CLI System Testing**: Got stuck in EOF reading loop
3. **Integration Verification**: Could test todo fetching but not full conversation flow
4. **Prompt Enhancement**: Unclear if enhanced prompts actually reach the LLM

## Technical Debt Created

1. **Multiple Integration Paths**: Now have both context graph and direct coach integration
2. **Unused Context System**: Context-aware LangGraph system built but not connected
3. **Testing Infrastructure**: No reliable way to test full integration
4. **Documentation Gap**: Real integration status unclear to user

## Evidence of Continued Hallucination

User reports coach still saying things like:
- "Looking at your tasks, I'm seeing some interesting candidates"
- "There's the 'Identify key problems to solve in 2025'"
- "Draft strategic plan for Stealth"

These are NOT in the user's actual Todoist, confirming the integration is not working in practice.

## Hypotheses for Root Cause

1. **System Prompt Not Enhanced**: Todo context may not be reaching the actual LLM calls
2. **Relevance Threshold Too High**: Keywords not matching conversational patterns
3. **LLM Response Caching**: Coach may be using cached responses instead of fresh context
4. **Architecture Mismatch**: Enhanced coach not being used by the CLI system

## Recommendations for Next Session

1. **Verify System Prompt**: Add debugging to confirm enhanced prompts reach LLM
2. **Lower Relevance Threshold**: Make todo fetching more aggressive
3. **Test Real Conversation**: Find way to test actual conversation flow
4. **Simplify Architecture**: Choose one integration path and remove others
5. **Add Debug Logging**: Trace exactly what context is being used

## Files Modified (All Changes Preserved)

- `src/orchestration/mcp_todo_node.py`: Real API integration
- `src/orchestration/context_graph.py`: Updated to use real MCP node
- `src/agents/coach_agent.py`: Added MCP integration methods
- `pyproject.toml`: Added MCP and Todoist dependencies

## Current Status

- **MCP Layer**: ✅ Working - can fetch real todos
- **Integration Layer**: ❓ Uncertain - modifications made but untested
- **User Experience**: ❌ Broken - still seeing hallucinated todos
- **Next Steps**: Requires deeper debugging of full conversation flow

The technical infrastructure for real MCP integration is in place and tested, but the user-facing coach behavior remains unchanged. This suggests a gap between the integration layer and the actual conversation generation that needs investigation.
