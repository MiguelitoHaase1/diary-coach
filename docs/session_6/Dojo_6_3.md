# Dojo Session 6.3: Multi-Modal Relevance Scoring for AI Context Systems

**Purpose**: Enable me to copy this learning theme into Claude.ai for deeper exploration of intelligent context detection systems.

**Context**: Built a sophisticated relevance scoring system that combines fast pattern matching with optional LLM analysis to determine when to fetch external context. The core challenge was balancing speed, accuracy, and configurability for different use cases.

**Challenge**: How do you build AI systems that can intelligently decide what external context to fetch without being explicitly told, while maintaining sub-second response times and avoiding information overload?

**Concept**: **Multi-Modal Relevance Scoring as Intelligence Layer** - This pattern represents a fundamental shift from "fetch everything" to "fetch intelligently" in AI systems. The key insight is that context fetching should be treated as a machine learning problem itself, where the system learns to predict what information will be useful based on conversational signals.

The multi-modal approach (pattern matching + LLM analysis) mirrors how humans process requests - we have both fast pattern recognition ("they said 'task' so they want action items") and slower semantic understanding ("they're struggling with strategic thinking, so they need frameworks"). This pattern scales to any context-heavy AI system where you need to balance speed, cost, and relevance.

For product managers, this represents a crucial capability: AI systems that can pull from vast knowledge bases without overwhelming users with irrelevant information. The configurability aspect means you can tune the system for different scenarios (quick check-ins vs. deep planning sessions).

**Other areas you could explore**:
1. **Semantic Similarity for Context Matching**: Using embeddings to find conceptually related context even when keywords don't match
2. **Adaptive Threshold Learning**: How AI systems can learn optimal relevance thresholds based on user feedback over time
3. **Context Budget Management**: Techniques for managing information density in AI conversations without losing important context
