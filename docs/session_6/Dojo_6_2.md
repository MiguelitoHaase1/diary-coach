# Dojo Session 6.2: Model Context Protocol (MCP) Integration Patterns

**Purpose**: Enable me to copy this learning theme into Claude.ai for deeper exploration of MCP and external context integration.

**Context**: Integrated the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to fetch todos from Todoist, implementing intelligent filtering based on conversation context. The core challenge was building a testable integration layer that can work both in mock mode (for development/testing) and production mode (with real MCP servers).

**Challenge**: How do you integrate AI systems with external data sources in a way that's both intelligent (context-aware filtering) and robust (error handling, testing, performance)?

**Concept**: **Model Context Protocol (MCP) as Universal Context Layer** - MCP represents a standardization breakthrough for AI context integration. Rather than building point-to-point integrations with every service (Todoist API, Google Calendar API, Notion API, etc.), MCP provides a unified protocol that AI systems can use to access external context.

The key insight is that context fetching should be both **selective** (only fetch when relevant) and **intelligent** (filter based on conversation content). This pattern scales to any external context source - documents, calendars, emails, code repositories. The MCP layer becomes a "context router" that can prioritize and filter information based on conversational relevance.

This is particularly powerful for product managers who need AI systems that can pull from multiple work contexts without overwhelming the conversation with irrelevant information.

**Other areas you could explore**:
1. **MCP Server Architecture**: How to build your own MCP servers for custom data sources  
2. **Context Caching Strategies**: Balancing freshness vs. performance for frequently accessed context
3. **Multi-Source Context Fusion**: Techniques for combining context from multiple MCP servers intelligently

**Configuration Note**: MCP servers typically use API tokens rather than passwords. For Todoist MCP integration, you'd configure your API token in the MCP server configuration file, not in the client code.
