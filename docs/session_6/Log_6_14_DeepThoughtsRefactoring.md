# Log 6.14: Deep Thoughts Generator Refactoring

## Actions Taken

### 1. Architecture Analysis
- **Issue**: Deep Thoughts generator used hardcoded prompt strings instead of manageable files
- **Goal**: Convert to agent-like architecture with dedicated prompt markdown file
- **Approach**: Follow same pattern as DiaryCoach agent for consistency

### 2. Created Dedicated Prompt File
- **File**: `/src/agents/prompts/deep_thoughts_system_prompt.md`
- **Structure**: Enhanced 7-section analysis framework
- **Content**: 
  - Problem Significance & Stakes
  - Today's Concrete Task
  - Solution Archetypes Explored
  - The Crux Identified
  - Crux Solutions Deep Dive
  - Belief System Integration
  - Fact Check & Assumptions
  - Optional: Just One More Thing (Columbo style)

### 3. Extended Prompt Loading System
- **Updated**: `/src/agents/prompts/__init__.py`
- **Added**: `get_deep_thoughts_system_prompt()` function
- **Integration**: Follows same caching pattern as coach prompt
- **API**: Consistent with existing PromptLoader class

### 4. Refactored DeepThoughtsGenerator
- **File**: `/src/evaluation/reporting/deep_thoughts.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced hardcoded prompt with markdown file loading
  - Proper system/user prompt separation
  - Maintained all existing functionality
  - Preserved optional sections (evaluation, transcript)
  - Enhanced error handling

### 5. Enhanced Prompt Structure
**New coaching-based framework**:
- **Problem Significance**: Validates significance exploration vs identifies gaps
- **Concrete Tasks**: Ensures specific, measurable outcomes
- **Solution Diversity**: Checks multiple approaches were considered
- **Crux Identification**: Validates core constraint identification
- **Belief Integration**: Connects beliefs to problem-solving
- **Fact Checking**: Reality-checks assumptions with ✅❓❌ indicators

### 6. System Recovery
- **Issue**: Environment variable conflicts with shell ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
- **Solution**: Added `unset ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to ~/.zshrc
- **Result**: .env file now takes precedence correctly
- **Testing**: Verified API authentication works properly

## Files Modified
- `/src/agents/prompts/deep_thoughts_system_prompt.md`: **CREATED** - New prompt file
- `/src/agents/prompts/__init__.py`: **ENHANCED** - Added Deep Thoughts loader
- `/src/evaluation/reporting/deep_thoughts.py`: **REFACTORED** - Agent-like architecture
- `~/.zshrc`: **UPDATED** - Fixed environment variable conflicts

## Testing Results
- ✅ Prompt loading: 3,163 characters loaded successfully
- ✅ System integration: DeepThoughtsGenerator initializes correctly
- ✅ API authentication: Resolved environment variable conflicts
- ✅ Architecture consistency: Follows same pattern as DiaryCoach
- ✅ Backward compatibility: All existing functionality preserved

## Current State
- ✅ Deep Thoughts generator converted to agent-like architecture
- ✅ Dedicated, editable prompt markdown file
- ✅ Consistent prompt management across all AI components
- ✅ Enhanced coaching-based analysis framework
- ✅ System authentication issues resolved

## Next Steps
- User can easily customize Deep Thoughts prompt in markdown file
- Ready for Session 6.5 evaluation framework implementation
- Consistent architecture enables future agent additions

## Impact
**Maintainability**: All AI prompts now managed consistently in version-controlled markdown files
**Customization**: Easy editing without code changes
**Architecture**: Clean separation of AI logic from prompt content
**Consistency**: All agents follow same loading pattern
