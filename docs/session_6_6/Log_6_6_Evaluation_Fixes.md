# Log Session 6.6: Evaluation System Fixes

## Session Overview
Fixed critical issues in the manual evaluation system where hardcoded 6/10 scores were being used instead of actual behavioral analysis.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Changed Deep Report to Use Claude Sonnet 4
- Modified `DeepThoughtsGenerator` default from `LLMTier.O3` to `LLMTier.STANDARD`
- Updated `enhanced_cli.py` initialization to use STANDARD tier
- Updated documentation strings to reflect Claude Sonnet 4 usage

### 2. Fixed Manual Testing Evaluation System
- **Problem**: Light reports were using hardcoded 0.6 (6/10) scores for all behavioral analyzers
- **Root Cause**: `generate_light_report` in `reporter.py` was creating mock AnalysisScore objects
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified to run actual behavioral analyzers
  - Added proper context building from conversation messages
  - Implemented real analyzer execution with `await analyzer.analyze()`

### 3. Enhanced Brief Reflection Generation
- Created `_generate_brief_reflection` method for light reports
- Provides concise analysis showing:
  - Overall score
  - Strongest behavioral area
  - Area needing improvement
  - Prompt to use deep report for full analysis

### 4. Updated Test Suite
- Fixed test assertions expecting old output messages
- Updated mocks to reflect new behavior (no file saving for light reports)
- Ensured all tests pass with new implementation

## Technical Details

### Key Changes in reporter.py:
```python
# Before: Hardcoded scores
score_value = 0.6  # Default moderate score
reasoning = "Light analysis - use 'deep report' for detailed evaluation"

# After: Actual analysis
score = await analyzer.analyze(coach_msg["content"], context)
behavioral_scores.append(score)
```

### Key Changes in deep_thoughts.py:
```python
# Before
tier: LLMTier = LLMTier.O3

# After  
tier: LLMTier = LLMTier.STANDARD  # Claude Sonnet 4
```

## Results
- Manual evaluations now show real behavioral analysis scores
- Each of the 7 coaching parameters gets properly evaluated
- Deep Thoughts reports use Claude Sonnet 4 for cost-effective generation
- All tests passing
