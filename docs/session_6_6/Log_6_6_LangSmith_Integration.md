# Session 6.6 Log: LangSmith Integration Fix

**Date**: July 11, 2025
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Outcome**: Successfully fixed LangSmith evaluation integration

## Problem Discovery

Started with the observation that evaluations were not appearing in the LangSmith dashboard despite appearing to run successfully.

### Initial Investigation

1. **Environment Check**
   - Verified LANGSMITH_API_KEY was set correctly
   - Confirmed LANGSMITH_PROJECT was configured
   - API connectivity test passed

2. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - Discovered the evaluation system was creating mock `Run` objects
   - These mock runs were being evaluated locally but not submitted to LangSmith
   - The issue was architectural: we weren't using LangSmith's evaluation framework

## Solution Implementation

### Step 1: Understanding LangSmith's Evaluation API

Created test scripts to understand the proper integration:
- `test_langsmith_connection.py` - Basic connectivity test
- `test_langsmith_eval_simple.py` - Minimal evaluation test

Key learning: Must use `langsmith.evaluation.evaluate` or `aevaluate` functions.

### Step 2: Creating Proper Integration

Developed `langsmith_eval_integration.py` with the correct pattern:
1. Create LangSmith dataset with examples
2. Define target function (what we're evaluating)
3. Wrap our evaluators in LangSmith-compatible functions
4. Use `aevaluate` to run the evaluation

### Step 3: Updating Main Test Runner

Modified `scripts/run_conversation_tests.py`:
```python
# Before: Creating mock Run objects
mock_run = Run(id=str(uuid.uuid4()), ...)
result = await evaluator.aevaluate_run(mock_run)

# After: Using LangSmith evaluation API
results = await aevaluate(
    coach_function,
    data=dataset_name,
    evaluators=langsmith_evaluators,
    experiment_prefix="coaching_eval",
    client=client
)
```

### Step 4: Verification

Created multiple verification scripts:
- `verify_langsmith_eval.py` - Quick verification tool
- `run_eval_demo.py` - Full demonstration with all 7 evaluators

## Technical Decisions

1. **Dataset-Based Evaluation**: LangSmith requires datasets with examples, not individual runs
2. **Evaluator Wrappers**: Our evaluators needed wrapper functions to match LangSmith's expected interface
3. **Async Support**: Used `aevaluate` for async evaluator support
4. **MCP Debug Disable**: Set `MCP_DEBUG=false` to prevent timeout from verbose logging

## Results

✅ **Full Integration Working**:
- Evaluations now appear in LangSmith dashboard
- All 7 evaluators + average score visible
- Experiment tracking with unique IDs
- Direct links to view results

✅ **Performance**:
- 4 evaluators: ~56 seconds
- 8 evaluators (7 + average): ~77 seconds
- Acceptable for development workflow

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `scripts/fix_langsmith_evaluations.py`
2. `scripts/langsmith_eval_integration.py`
3. `scripts/test_langsmith_eval_simple.py`
4. `scripts/test_langsmith_connection.py`
5. `scripts/verify_langsmith_eval.py`
6. `scripts/run_eval_demo.py`

### Modified Files
1. `scripts/run_conversation_tests.py` - Updated to use proper LangSmith API
2. `docs/session_6_6/Session_6_6_Completion_Log.md` - Added fix documentation

## Key Learnings

1. **Mock objects != Real integration**: Creating mock Run objects bypasses LangSmith's tracking
2. **Dataset requirement**: LangSmith evaluations work on datasets, not individual runs
3. **Wrapper pattern**: Evaluators need adaptation to match LangSmith's expected interface
4. **Documentation matters**: LangSmith docs were crucial for understanding the correct pattern

## Next Steps

- Monitor evaluation performance in production
- Consider caching strategies for expensive evaluations
- Explore LangSmith's comparison features for A/B testing
