# Multi-Agent Diary Coach Lesson Plan: Text-First TDD with Redis & LangChain (Prototype-Driven Evolution)

## Executive Summary

Build a multi-agent coaching system using Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Redis Pub/Sub for event-driven architecture. uild a working prototype early (Session 2), then evolve it through data-driven improvements in each subsequent session.
