# Log 7.1: Evaluation System Update

**Date**: 2025-07-12
**Focus**: Implement new 5-criteria evaluation system per Session_6_8.md

## Summary

Updated the evaluation system to use 5 focused criteria instead of 7, and removed separate evaluation markdown reports. Evaluations are now performed by Claude Opus within Deep Thoughts reports.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated LangSmithEvaluators (`src/evaluation/langsmith_evaluators.py`)

Replaced 7 evaluators with 5 new ones:
- **A - Problem Definition** (binary 0-1): Define biggest problem to solve and understand why it matters
- **B - Crux Recognition** (binary 0-1): Recognize the key constraint to address
- **C - Today Accomplishment** (binary 0-1): Define exactly what to accomplish today
- **D - Multiple Paths** (real 0-1): Define multiple viable and different paths forward
- **E - Core Beliefs** (real 0-1): Define which core beliefs/tenets to focus on

Key improvements:
- Switched from CHEAP tier (GPT-4o-mini) to STANDARD tier (Claude Sonnet) for better evaluation quality
- Increased max_tokens from 800 to 1500 to prevent timeouts
- Simplified evaluation prompts to focus on specific criteria
- Fixed scoring to match new scale (binary scores already 0-1, no normalization needed)

### 2. Removed Eval Markdown Reports

Per Session_6_8 requirement: "Stop making 'eval' markdown reports"
- Removed `_generate_summary_report` method from `eval_command.py`
- Removed `eval_exporter` references from `enhanced_cli.py`
- Set `include_evals=False` when generating Deep Thoughts reports
- Cleaned up unused imports

### 3. Deep Thoughts Integration

The evaluation now happens within Deep Thoughts reports:
- `deep_thoughts_system_prompt.md` already includes the 5 evaluation criteria in the appendix section
- Claude Opus performs evaluation freely based on these criteria
- No separate evaluation files are generated

### 4. Code Quality

Fixed all linting issues:
- Removed unused imports (asyncio, Path, LLMFactory)
- Fixed line length issues (88 character limit)
- Added missing newlines at end of files
- Properly wrapped long lines with backslashes

## Technical Details

### API Timeout Issue Resolution
The original timeout issue was caused by:
1. Using CHEAP tier (GPT-4o-mini) with only 800 max tokens
2. Trying to evaluate entire coaching conversations
3. Complex evaluation prompts requiring detailed JSON responses

Fixed by:
1. Upgrading to STANDARD tier (Claude Sonnet)
2. Increasing max_tokens to 1500
3. Simplifying evaluation prompts

### File Changes Summary
- `src/evaluation/langsmith_evaluators.py`: Complete rewrite of evaluators
- `src/evaluation/eval_command.py`: Removed summary report generation
- `src/interface/enhanced_cli.py`: Removed eval export functionality
- All files: Fixed linting issues

## Testing Notes

The new evaluation system should be tested with:
- Short conversations to verify basic functionality
- Long conversations to ensure no timeouts
- Various coaching scenarios to validate all 5 criteria

## Next Steps

1. Run comprehensive tests with the new evaluation system
2. Monitor for any timeout issues with the increased token limit
3. Validate that Deep Thoughts reports include proper evaluation in appendix
4. Consider adjusting evaluation prompts based on real-world results
