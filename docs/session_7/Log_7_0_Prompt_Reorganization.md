# Session 7.0 Log: Prompt Reorganization

**Date**: July 12, 2025  
**Duration**: ~20 minutes  
**Status**: Complete âœ…

## Context
Before starting the planned Session 7 work on parallel orchestration, Michael requested reorganization of the coach agent prompts to follow the same pattern as the Deep Thoughts system - with all prompts defined in markdown files that the Python code loads dynamically.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Analyzed Existing Prompt Structure
- Found `deep_thoughts_system_prompt.md` as the pattern to follow
- Discovered coach agent had prompts split between:
  - `coach_system_prompt.md` (philosophy/style)
  - Python hardcoded `MORNING_PROMPT_ADDITION` (procedural)

### 2. Created Morning Protocol Markdown
- **File**: `src/agents/prompts/coach_morning_protocol.md`
- Extracted the entire morning protocol from Python
- Maintained exact content and formatting
- Now serves as the master source for morning behavior

### 3. Updated PromptLoader Infrastructure
- Added `get_coach_morning_protocol()` method to PromptLoader class
- Added convenience function for easy imports
- Follows same pattern as other prompt loaders

### 4. Modified Coach Agent Implementation
- Changed `MORNING_PROMPT_ADDITION` from hardcoded string to property
- Property now loads from markdown via `get_coach_morning_protocol()`
- Added proper newline spacing when combining prompts
- Import updated to include new function

### 5. Code Quality Check
- Ran flake8 linter
- Found multiple style issues (to be addressed separately)
- Core functionality working correctly

## Result
The coach agent now loads all its prompts from markdown files:
- `coach_system_prompt.md` - Core philosophy and constraints
- `coach_morning_protocol.md` - Morning-specific procedures

This allows behavior modification through markdown edits without touching Python code, matching the Deep Thoughts pattern.

## Technical Details
- Used `@property` decorator to maintain backward compatibility
- Preserved exact prompt content during migration
- Maintained separation between style guide and procedural logic

## Next Steps
- Address flake8 linting issues in coach_agent.py
- Consider creating additional prompt files for other time periods
- Begin actual Session 7 work on parallel orchestration
