# Session 7.2: LangSmith Evaluator Fixes and Deep Thoughts Integration

## Session Overview
**Date**: 2025-07-13
**Goal**: Fix LangSmith evaluators to properly score conversations and integrate with Deep Thoughts generation
**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully fixed all evaluators and integrated proper Deep Thoughts generation

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Evaluation Output Display
- Removed evaluation parameters/behavioral analysis output before deep report generation
- Removed manual subjective evaluation section from Deep Thoughts reports
- Cleaned up the prototype flow to only show the deep report prompt after notes

**Files Modified**:
- `src/interface/enhanced_cli.py`: Removed evaluation display code
- `src/evaluation/reporting/deep_thoughts.py`: Removed manual evaluation sections

### 2. Fixed LangSmith Evaluator Scoring Issues

#### Problem
- All evaluators were returning scores of 0
- JSON parsing was failing due to control characters
- Only 3 evaluators were showing instead of 5

#### Solution
- Improved JSON extraction to handle markdown code blocks and control characters
- Standardized all evaluators to use 0.0-1.0 scoring (instead of binary)
- Updated evaluation prompts to request cleaner JSON output

**Files Modified**:
- `src/evaluation/langsmith_evaluators.py`: 
  - Enhanced JSON parsing with regex fallback
  - Standardized scoring across all evaluators
  - Improved prompt clarity

### 3. Integrated Proper Deep Thoughts Generation

#### Problem
- Deep Thoughts were being generated with GPT o3 instead of Sonnet 4
- Lack of tracing for Deep Thoughts generation in LangSmith

#### Solution
- Updated conversation test runner to use Sonnet 4 (LLMTier.STANDARD)
- Added LangSmith tracing decorators to Deep Thoughts generation
- Fixed LLM factory to properly map STANDARD tier to claude-sonnet-4

**Files Modified**:
- `src/evaluation/conversation_test_runner.py`: Changed from O3 to STANDARD tier
- `src/evaluation/reporting/deep_thoughts.py`: Added @traceable decorators
- `src/services/llm_service.py`: Updated STANDARD tier to use claude-sonnet-4

### 4. Created Supporting Infrastructure

**New Files**:
- `src/evaluation/deep_thoughts_score_extractor.py`: Score extraction from Deep Thoughts
- `src/evaluation/deep_thoughts_evaluator.py`: Alternative evaluator using Deep Thoughts

## Technical Details

### Evaluator Improvements
```python
# Before: Simple JSON parsing
parsed = json.loads(result)

# After: Robust JSON extraction
json_str = result.strip()
if "```json" in json_str:
    json_str = json_str.split("```json")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
elif "```" in json_str:
    json_str = json_str.split("```")[1].split("```")[0].strip()

try:
    parsed = json.loads(json_str)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    # Regex fallback for embedded JSON
    json_match = re.search(r'\{[^{}]*(?:\{[^{}]*\}[^{}]*)*\}', result, re.DOTALL)
    if json_match:
        json_text = json_match.group()
        json_text = json_text.replace('\n', ' ').replace('\r', ' ').replace('\t', ' ')
        parsed = json.loads(json_text)
```

### Scoring Standardization
All evaluators now use graduated scoring:
- 0.0: No evidence of criterion
- 0.5: Partial achievement
- 1.0: Full achievement

### LangSmith Integration
Added tracing to key methods:
- `@traceable(name="generate_deep_thoughts")`
- `@traceable(name="deep_thoughts_analysis")`
- `@traceable(name="generate_deep_report")`

## Test Results

Successfully ran evaluation test with:
- ✅ All 5 evaluators returning proper scores
- ✅ Deep Thoughts generated with Sonnet 4
- ✅ Full LangSmith tracing enabled
- ✅ Individual scores visible for each criterion

## Lessons Learned

1. **JSON Parsing Robustness**: LLM outputs often include markdown formatting that needs careful handling
2. **Model Configuration**: Important to verify which model is actually being used for each tier
3. **Tracing Integration**: Adding LangSmith tracing helps debug evaluation pipelines
4. **Graduated Scoring**: Binary scores are too limiting for nuanced evaluation criteria

## Next Steps

- Monitor evaluator performance in production experiments
- Consider implementing direct Deep Thoughts score extraction (as suggested)
- Fine-tune scoring thresholds based on real conversation data
