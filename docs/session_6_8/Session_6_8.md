I: have only these 5 evals (just let Claude Opus do the evaluation a bit freely in the deep report)
A - Define biggest problem to solve - and understand why this problem matters (binary 1-0 score)
B - Recognize the key constraint to adress ('the crux') (binary 1-0 score)
C - Define exactly what to accomplish today to adress the crux (binary 1-0 score)
D - Define multiple viable and different paths forward to adress crux (real score from 0 to 1)
E - Define which 'core beliefs'/'tenets' to focus on when working the problem (real score from 0 to 1)

II: Stop making 'eval' markdown reports - no need for those, neither evals within deep reports
