# Session 10 - Log 10.13: Web Search Tool Response Handling Fix

## Date: 2025-08-06

### Objective
Fix the web search tool to actually return real URLs by properly handling Anthropic's web search tool responses.

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Problem Discovered
The web search was not returning real URLs because:
1. **Tool Response Format**: Anthropic's web search tool returns responses in multiple content blocks (text, server_tool_use, web_search_tool_result), not just a single text block
2. **LLM Service Bug**: The service was trying to access `response.content[0].text` directly, which failed when tool responses contained multiple blocks
3. **Silent Failure**: The incomplete response parsing caused early termination of the search results

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Fixed LLM Service Response Handling
Modified `src/services/llm_service.py` to properly handle tool responses:
```python
# Extract response text - handle tool use responses
response_text = ""
for block in response.content:
    if hasattr(block, 'type'):
        if block.type == 'text':
            response_text += block.text + "\n"
        elif block.type in [
            'server_tool_use', 'web_search_tool_result'
        ]:
            # Tool responses are in text blocks
            continue
```

#### 2. Verified Tool Configuration
- Confirmed correct tool type: `web_search_20250305`
- Tool properly configured with `max_uses: 5`
- Web search is enabled and working

### Testing Results

âœ… **Web Search Now Returns Real URLs**:
- Harvard Business Review articles with actual URLs
- MIT Sloan Management Review articles with real links
- McKinsey insights with working URLs
- All URLs are clickable and lead to real articles

### Example Output
```
"Hybrid Still Isn't Working" - Harvard Business Review
URL: https://hbr.org/2025/07/hybrid-still-isnt-working

"How AI Is Redefining Managerial Roles" - Harvard Business Review
URL: https://hbr.org/2025/07/how-ai-is-redefining-managerial-roles
```

### Files Modified
- `src/services/llm_service.py` - Fixed tool response handling
- Created test scripts to verify functionality

### Verification
- âœ… All tests passing (5/5 LLM service tests)
- âœ… No linting errors
- âœ… Web search returns real, working URLs
- âœ… Proper handling of multiple content blocks

### Important Notes

#### For Users
ðŸ”´ **HUMAN SETUP REQUIRED**:
- Web search costs $10 per 1,000 searches
- Must be enabled in Anthropic Console
- Currently only available in US for paid accounts
- Organization admin must enable the feature

#### Technical Details
- Web search automatically triggers when Claude determines it would be helpful
- Results include citations and sources
- Tool responses contain multiple content blocks that must be parsed correctly
- Each search can return multiple articles with real URLs

### Learning Opportunities
1. **Tool Response Structure**: Anthropic's tool responses use multiple content blocks, not just text
2. **Debugging Approach**: Creating minimal test scripts helps isolate issues quickly
3. **Documentation Importance**: Official API docs revealed the correct tool configuration
4. **Response Parsing**: Always check response structure before assuming format

### Next Steps
- Monitor web search usage and costs
- Consider caching frequent searches
- Add better error handling for quota limits
- Implement domain filtering if needed
