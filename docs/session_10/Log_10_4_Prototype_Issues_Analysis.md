# Log 10.4: Prototype Issues Analysis

**Date**: July 31, 2025
**Purpose**: Document critical issues discovered during prototype run
**Impact**: Multi-agent system partially broken - requires immediate fixes

## Issue Summary

A prototype run on 2025-07-31 22:09:35 revealed three critical issues with the multi-agent coaching system that prevent it from functioning as designed.

## Issue 1: Deep Report Incomplete

### Description
The Deep Thoughts report generation terminated early without completing the full analysis.

### Evidence
- **File**: `/docs/prototype/DeepThoughts/DeepThoughts_20250731_220935.md`
- **Expected**: Full report with complete sections and proper conclusion
- **Actual**: Report ends abruptly at line 98 after "Recommended readings" section

### Symptoms
- Report has good content up to line 77 (main conclusion)
- Recommended readings section starts at line 79
- No actual web search results integrated
- Report appears truncated

### Potential Causes
1. Token limit reached in reporter agent
2. Timeout in Stage 3 processing
3. Error in report enhancement logic that causes early termination

## Issue 2: Web Search Agent Not Executing

### Description
Despite Session 10.3 claiming successful web search integration, the agent is not actually performing web searches.

### Evidence
- **File**: `/docs/prototype/DeepThoughts/DeepThoughts_20250731_220935.md` (lines 98)
- **Telltale Sign**: "Note: Since I cannot perform real web searches in this context, these are suggested search queries that should yield relevant, high-quality articles on these topics."

### Analysis
The Deep Thoughts report includes search suggestions but no actual search results, indicating:
1. Web Search Agent is not being invoked in Stage 3
2. The `_enhance_report_with_search()` method may not be executing
3. Theme extraction might be failing, preventing web search invocation

### Code to Check
```python
# src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py - Stage 3 flow
# Check if web_search_agent is properly called after reporter_agent
```

## Issue 3: Phase 2 Agent Communication Broken

### Description
The coaching agent failed to properly invoke the deep thoughts reporter agent, instead exposing raw invocation context to the user.

### Evidence
- **File**: `/docs/prototype/DeepThoughts/Evaluation_20250731_220935.md`
- **Transcript Lines**: 71-124

### Problematic Exchange
```
**User**: ok

**Assistant**: <invoke name="deep_thoughts_reporter">
<parameter name="context">Michael has identified his crux for today: He needs to crystallize his own philosophy about design organization to confidently respond to his boss about the future structure of their design org. 

Key details:
- Has one crucial day with Nisse (design leader) before Nisse goes on holiday
- Boss is pressuring for quick response about "what to do with all that design"
...
```

### Issues Identified
1. The assistant literally shows the `<invoke>` tag to the user
2. The context parameter is displayed as chat content
3. The user sees internal agent communication
4. The conversation flow is completely broken
5. User had to stop the conversation (line 124)

### Root Cause Hypothesis
The enhanced coach agent may be:
1. Missing proper agent invocation handling
2. Treating agent calls as regular text output
3. Not properly awaiting agent responses
4. Missing the agent registry integration

## Technical Investigation Plan

### 1. Reporter Agent Termination
```bash
# Check reporter agent implementation
grep -n "Recommended readings" src/agents/reporter_agent.py
# Check token limits
grep -n "max_tokens" src/agents/reporter_agent.py
```

### 2. Web Search Integration
```bash
# Verify Stage 3 flow
grep -A 20 "stage.*3" src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py
# Check theme extraction
grep -n "extract.*theme" src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py
# Verify web search agent invocation
grep -n "web_search_agent" src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py
```

### 3. Agent Communication
```bash
# Check enhanced coach agent
grep -n "invoke.*deep_thoughts" src/agents/enhanced_coach_agent.py
# Verify agent registry usage
grep -n "agent_registry" src/agents/enhanced_coach_agent.py
# Check phase 2 implementation
grep -A 10 "phase.*2" src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py
```

## Recommended Fixes

### Priority 1: Fix Agent Communication (Issue 3)
This completely breaks the user experience and must be fixed first.

**Steps**:
1. Review enhanced_coach_agent.py for proper agent invocation
2. Ensure agent calls are handled internally, not displayed to user
3. Add proper error handling for agent communication
4. Test phase 2 transition thoroughly

### Priority 2: Fix Web Search Integration (Issue 2)
The feature claims to be complete but isn't working.

**Steps**:
1. Debug Stage 3 flow in multi_agent_cli.py
2. Verify theme extraction is working
3. Ensure web_search_agent is properly invoked
4. Check report enhancement logic
5. Add logging to trace execution flow

### Priority 3: Fix Report Termination (Issue 1)
Less critical but still important for complete functionality.

**Steps**:
1. Check token limits in reporter agent
2. Add completion verification
3. Implement retry logic if needed
4. Test with various report lengths

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Test phase 2 transition with "deep report" command
- [ ] Verify agent communication is internal only
- [ ] Check Deep Thoughts report completeness
- [ ] Verify web search results appear in report
- [ ] Test error handling for each failure mode

### Automated Test Coverage Needed
- [ ] Test for agent invocation format
- [ ] Test for web search integration
- [ ] Test for report completeness
- [ ] Test for error recovery

## Files to Review

1. `/src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py` - Main orchestration logic
2. `/src/agents/enhanced_coach_agent.py` - Agent communication handling
3. `/src/agents/reporter_agent.py` - Report generation and termination
4. `/src/agents/web_search_agent.py` - Web search execution
5. `/tests/integration/test_multi_agent_e2e.py` - Integration test coverage

## Success Criteria

The system will be considered fixed when:
1. Phase 2 properly invokes agents without exposing internals to user
2. Deep Thoughts reports include actual web search results
3. Reports complete fully without truncation
4. All integration tests pass
5. Manual testing confirms smooth user experience
