# Session 10.0: Personal Content Agent LLM Integration

**Date**: July 30, 2025
**Duration**: 1 increment (~45 minutes)
**Approach**: Transform personal content agent from procedural logic to LLM-powered synthesis
**Result**: Claude Sonnet 4 now intelligently analyzes personal documents

## Summary

Upgraded the personal content agent from simple keyword matching to intelligent LLM-based content synthesis. The agent now uses Claude Sonnet 4 to understand context and provide nuanced insights from personal documentation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Personal Folder Structure Update

The user reorganized their personal context documents into a new structure:
- `docs/personal/AboutMe/` - Contains various aspects of personal/professional background
- `docs/personal/Beliefs/` - Contains core beliefs and principles

Updated code to handle recursive directory scanning with `rglob("*.md")`.

### 2. LLM Integration

**Before**: Simple keyword matching and TF-IDF style relevance scoring
**After**: Claude Sonnet 4 analyzes documents and synthesizes relevant insights

Key changes in `src/agents/personal_content_agent.py`:
- Added `LLMFactory` import and created LLM service using `STANDARD` tier
- Replaced `_format_personal_content_response()` with async LLM-powered version
- Created `_build_synthesis_prompt()` to structure LLM context
- Removed hardcoded integration suggestions in favor of LLM intelligence

### 3. Test Updates

Updated `tests/agents/test_personal_content_agent.py`:
- Added mock LLM service fixture
- Updated all test functions to use the mock
- Adjusted assertions to match new response format
- Removed checks for `relevance_scores` (no longer in metadata)

### 4. Code Quality

- Fixed all linting issues (88-character line limit)
- Removed unused imports
- Cleaned up trailing whitespace
- All tests passing (138 total)

## Technical Details

### LLM Prompt Structure

The new synthesis prompt includes:
1. Clear role definition for the LLM
2. User's query
3. All relevant personal documents (respecting chunk size limits)
4. Instructions for structured output with two sections:
   - RELEVANT CONTEXT: Key insights from documents
   - SUGGESTED INTEGRATION: How to weave insights into coaching

### Performance Considerations

- Uses standard Claude Sonnet 4 for balance of quality and speed
- Respects existing chunk size limits (2000 chars default)
- Document loader still does initial filtering to reduce LLM context
- Tests use mocks to maintain fast test execution

### Benefits of LLM Approach

1. **Semantic Understanding**: Understands meaning, not just keywords
2. **Context Awareness**: Can make connections between different documents
3. **Natural Language**: Provides human-like synthesis of information
4. **Adaptive Integration**: Suggestions tailored to specific query context
5. **Future Extensibility**: Easy to enhance with more sophisticated prompts

## Test Results

All 138 tests pass successfully:
- Personal content agent tests: 10/10 ✅
- Related tests (enhanced coach): 1/1 ✅
- Full test suite: 138 passed, 1 warning

## Next Steps

1. Monitor LLM token usage in production
2. Consider caching LLM responses for repeated queries
3. Fine-tune prompt for even better synthesis
4. Add user feedback mechanism to improve responses

## Files Modified

- `src/agents/personal_content_agent.py` - Core implementation
- `src/orchestration/document_loader.py` - Updated for recursive scanning
- `tests/agents/test_personal_content_agent.py` - Test updates
- All changes respect CLAUDE.md guidelines and pass linting
