# Session 10.2: Claude Opus Overload Fix - Remove Fallback & Add Retry Logic

**Date**: July 31, 2025
**Duration**: 1 increment (~45 minutes)
**Approach**: Remove GPT-4o fallback and implement exponential backoff retry for Opus
**Result**: Cleaner architecture with robust retry mechanism for handling overload

## User Request

The user requested:
1. Drop the backup solutions (remove GPT-4o fallback code)
2. Stick with Opus for deep think and Sonnet for the context agent
3. Fix the underlying issue

## Investigation

### Architecture Analysis

1. **Orchestrator Agent**: Uses Claude Sonnet (via `self.llm_service` from multi_agent_cli.py)
2. **Reporter Agent**: Uses Claude Opus (premium tier) for Deep Thoughts generation
3. **Personal Content Agent**: Was using GPT-4o for load balancing

### Stage 3 Flow

During Stage 3, the system:
1. Gathers agent contributions directly (NOT through orchestrator)
2. Calls Reporter Agent which uses Opus to synthesize
3. Calls Evaluator Agent for assessment

The orchestrator is NOT involved in Stage 3, so the original theory about "dual duty" was incorrect.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Removed GPT-4o Fallback from deep_thoughts.py

- Deleted all fallback logic that would switch to GPT-4o on overload
- Simplified exception handling to return error content on failure
- Kept the basic error handling structure

### 2. Added Exponential Backoff Retry Logic

```python
# Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
max_retries = 5
base_delay = 2  # Start with 2 seconds

for attempt in range(max_retries):
    try:
        # Make API call
        return analysis_content
    except Exception as e:
        if "500" in error_msg and "Overloaded" in error_msg:
            if attempt < max_retries - 1:
                delay = base_delay * (2 ** attempt)  # 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s
                logger.warning(f"Claude Opus overloaded, retrying in {delay}s")
                await asyncio.sleep(delay)
                continue
```

This provides:
- Up to 5 retry attempts
- Exponentially increasing delays: 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, 32s
- Total maximum wait time: 62 seconds
- Only retries on 500 "Overloaded" errors

### 3. Updated Personal Content Agent to Use Claude Sonnet

- Changed from GPT-4o (PREMIUM tier with OpenAI) to Claude Sonnet (STANDARD tier)
- Updated metadata to reflect correct model: "claude-sonnet-4"
- This reduces load on Opus by moving personal content synthesis to Sonnet

### 4. Code Quality

- Fixed all linting issues (removed unused import, fixed whitespace, line length)
- All tests pass for personal_content_agent.py

## Technical Details

### Model Distribution After Fix
- **Coach Agent**: Claude Sonnet
- **Orchestrator Agent**: Claude Sonnet
- **Personal Content Agent**: Claude Sonnet (changed from GPT-4o)
- **Reporter Agent**: Claude Opus (for Deep Thoughts)
- **Evaluator Agent**: Claude Sonnet

### Retry Mechanism
- Only retries on specific overload errors
- Uses exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the API
- Logs warnings for each retry attempt
- Falls back to error content after all retries exhausted

## Files Modified

1. `src/evaluation/reporting/deep_thoughts.py`
   - Removed GPT-4o fallback logic
   - Added exponential backoff retry
   - Added logging support

2. `src/agents/personal_content_agent.py`
   - Changed from GPT-4o to Claude Sonnet
   - Updated metadata

3. `docs/status.md`
   - Added Session 10.2 documentation
   - Removed active issue for Claude Opus overload
   - Updated Personal Content Agent description

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simple Solutions First**: Exponential backoff is often more robust than fallback models
2. **Load Distribution**: Moving non-critical agents to Sonnet reduces Opus load
3. **Architecture Understanding**: The orchestrator wasn't involved in Stage 3, simplifying the fix
4. **Clean Code**: Removing complex fallback logic made the code cleaner and more maintainable

## Next Steps

If overload issues persist:
1. Consider increasing retry delays or attempts
2. Implement request queuing for Deep Thoughts
3. Consider caching partial results to reduce API calls
4. Monitor which specific requests cause overload
