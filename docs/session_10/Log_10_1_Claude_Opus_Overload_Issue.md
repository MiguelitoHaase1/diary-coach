# Session 10.1: Claude Opus Overload Issue & Fallback Implementation

**Date**: July 30, 2025
**Duration**: 1 increment (~30 minutes)
**Approach**: Implement GPT-4o fallback for Deep Thoughts when Claude Opus is overloaded
**Result**: Fallback implemented but still experiencing failures

## Issue Description

User reported error when generating Deep Thoughts:
```
Error generating Deep Thoughts: API call failed after 3 attempts: Error code: 500 - {'type': 'error', 'error': {'type': 'api_error', 'message': 'Overloaded'}}
```

## Changes Implemented

### 1. GPT-4o Fallback for Deep Thoughts

Modified `src/evaluation/reporting/deep_thoughts.py` to:
- Catch `AnthropicError` with 500/Overloaded status
- Automatically fallback to GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2024-11-20)
- Add debug logging to track error catching
- Also handle general `Exception` in case error type varies
- Add note to generated report when fallback is used

### 2. Personal Content Agent Load Balancing

Updated `src/agents/personal_content_agent.py` to:
- Always use GPT-4o instead of Claude Sonnet
- Reduce overall load on Anthropic API
- Add metadata indicating `"llm_model": "gpt-4o"`

### 3. Technical Implementation

```python
# Fallback detection logic
if (("500" in error_msg and "Overloaded" in error_msg) or
        "Error code: 500" in error_msg):
    print("ðŸ”„ Claude Opus is overloaded, falling back to GPT-4o...")
    # Create GPT-4o service and retry
```

## Current Status

Despite the fallback implementation, the system is still failing with the same error. This suggests:

1. The error might be happening at a different level
2. The fallback might not be triggering correctly
3. There might be multiple places using Claude Opus

## Root Cause Theory

**User's insight**: The issue might be architectural - we're asking Claude Opus to both:
1. Orchestrate multiple agents (Orchestrator Agent)
2. Generate the Deep Thoughts report (Reporter Agent)

This double duty during Stage 3 might be overwhelming the system, especially with:
- Multiple agent responses to synthesize
- Complex prompt construction
- Large context windows

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

1. **Investigate Architecture**:
   - Check if Orchestrator is also using Opus
   - Consider using different models for different roles
   - Look at Stage 3 execution flow

2. **Optimize Load Distribution**:
   - Orchestrator: Maybe use Sonnet instead of Opus?
   - Reporter: Keep Opus but with smaller context?
   - Or vice versa - specialized models for specialized tasks

3. **Alternative Approaches**:
   - Sequential processing instead of parallel
   - Caching partial results
   - Pre-filtering agent responses before synthesis

4. **Debug the Fallback**:
   - Add more logging to trace exact failure point
   - Test fallback in isolation
   - Check if error format matches our detection

## Files Modified

- `src/evaluation/reporting/deep_thoughts.py` - Added GPT-4o fallback logic
- `src/agents/personal_content_agent.py` - Switched to GPT-4o
- `tests/agents/test_personal_content_agent.py` - Updated tests

## Lessons Learned

- Error handling needs to be at the right level
- Load balancing across LLM providers is important
- Architecture decisions (which agent uses which model) matter for reliability
- Sometimes the issue is systemic rather than a simple fix
