# Session 10 - Log 10.10: Code Review Cleanup

## Date: 2025-08-03

### Objective
Address code review feedback by removing redundant code artifacts from the Stage 3 refactoring.

### Code Review Findings Addressed

#### 1. Removed Redundant Web Search Wrapper Method
**Issue**: `_coordinate_web_search_for_report` was just a thin wrapper calling `coordinate_phase3_search`
**Fix**: 
- Deleted `_coordinate_web_search_for_report` method (lines 594-607)
- Updated Stage 3 to call `coordinate_phase3_search` directly
- Cleaner code flow without unnecessary indirection

#### 2. Removed Unused Variable in CLI
**Issue**: `agent_contributions` variable extracted but never used after Stage 3 refactoring
**Fix**:
- Removed variable declaration (line 390)
- Removed variable assignment (line 407)
- Variable was a remnant from when CLI directly managed agent calls

### Impact
- **Code Quality**: Cleaner, more maintainable code
- **Law 4 Compliance**: No orphaned code from architecture transition
- **Performance**: Negligible (one less variable assignment)
- **Testing**: All tests still passing (9 orchestrator tests, 5 smoke tests)

### Files Modified
- `src/agents/orchestrator_agent.py` - Removed redundant wrapper method
- `src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py` - Removed unused variable

### Verification
✅ All imports working
✅ Orchestrator tests passing
✅ Smoke tests passing
✅ No unused variable warnings from linter

### Lesson Learned
When refactoring architecture patterns, thoroughly review for:
- Wrapper methods that no longer serve a purpose
- Variables that were part of the old flow but not the new one
- Comments and documentation that reference old patterns
