# Session 10.3: Web Search Agent Integration

**Date**: 2025-01-30
**Goal**: Integrate Web Search Agent into multi-agent system for Deep Thoughts reports
**Outcome**: ✅ Successfully integrated Web Search Agent using two-phase approach

## Summary

Successfully integrated the Web Search Agent into the multi-agent architecture, enabling automatic web search for relevant articles when generating Deep Thoughts reports. Implemented a two-phase approach where the Reporter Agent first generates the report, then the Web Search Agent enhances it with article recommendations.

## Key Changes

### 1. Created Web Search Agent (`src/agents/web_search_agent.py`)
- Extends BaseAgent with proper capabilities (WEB_SEARCH, RESEARCH, CONTENT_CURATION)
- Integrates with existing prompt at `src/agents/prompts/web_search_agent_prompt.md`
- Handles theme extraction and article curation
- Returns formatted recommendations

### 2. Updated Multi-Agent CLI (`src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py`)
- Added Web Search Agent initialization
- Integrated into Stage 3 flow after Reporter generates Deep Thoughts
- Extracts themes from report using regex
- Enhances report with search results via `_enhance_report_with_search()`

### 3. Added Missing AgentCapabilities (`src/agents/base.py`)
- Added WEB_SEARCH, RESEARCH, and CONTENT_CURATION capabilities
- Required for Web Search Agent registration

### 4. Updated Deep Thoughts Prompt (`src/agents/prompts/deep_thoughts_system_prompt.md`)
- Modified to provide search suggestions instead of fake articles
- Added clear instructions for theme identification
- Honest about not having direct search capability

## Technical Implementation

### Two-Phase Approach
1. **Phase 1**: Reporter Agent generates Deep Thoughts with search suggestions
2. **Phase 2**: Web Search Agent extracts themes and provides real recommendations

### Integration Flow
```
User: "deep report"
  ↓
Reporter Agent → Deep Thoughts with themes
  ↓
Theme Extraction → ["mindfulness at work", "work-life integration", ...]
  ↓
Web Search Agent → Article recommendations
  ↓
Report Enhancement → Final report with real articles
```

### Key Code Sections

**Theme Extraction** (multi_agent_cli.py:430-453):
```python
# Extract themes from "recommend searching for articles on these themes:"
theme_match = re.search(
    r'recommend searching for articles on these themes:(.*?)(?:\n\n|\Z)', 
    deep_thoughts_report, 
    re.DOTALL
)
```

**Report Enhancement** (multi_agent_cli.py:623-659):
- Finds "Recommended readings" section
- Replaces with Web Search Agent results
- Preserves rest of report structure

## Challenges Resolved

1. **LLM Hallucinating Articles**: Fixed by updating prompts to be honest about search limitations
2. **Integration Pattern**: Chose post-processing over orchestrator modification for cleaner implementation
3. **Missing Capabilities**: Added required enum values to base.py

## Testing

Successfully tested with existing transcript:
- Generated Deep Thoughts report
- Extracted themes correctly
- Web Search Agent provided relevant recommendations
- Final report properly enhanced

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Real Web Search**: Currently returns high-quality suggestions. To get actual URLs:
   - Option 1: Integrate web search API (Brave, Google, etc.)
   - Option 2: Use Claude's native WebSearch when available
   - Option 3: Use Firecrawl MCP for actual scraping

2. **Enhance Theme Extraction**: Could use LLM for more sophisticated theme identification

3. **Caching**: Consider caching search results for repeated themes

## Learning Opportunities

1. **Agent Communication**: Successfully used standard AgentRequest/AgentResponse pattern
2. **Two-Phase Processing**: Effective pattern for enhancing existing outputs
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Being honest about limitations prevents hallucination
