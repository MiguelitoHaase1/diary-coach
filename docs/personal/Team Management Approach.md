# Team Management Approach

Michael is conducting interviews with a developer, a designer, and a project manager from each product team to assess [[Organizational Health]], collaboration efforts, and engagement within the product teams.

Michael prefers a more collaborative and reflective approach when setting [[OKRs]], where key results focus on the emotional and motivational aspects of the product team that will take over the incubation project. Key themes for him include excitement, humility, empowerment, and clarity. He wants OKRs to reflect more than just product-market fit, focusing on creating the right environment for pivoting, learning, and alignment between product owners and the incubated product.

Michael believes that the clarity of vision, especially around the outcome or the human behavior change to achieve, is the most important factor in making a product owner feel excited when taking over a project. He emphasizes the importance of clearly describing the problem to solve through an [[Opportunity Solution Tree]], with a detailed understanding of the key jobs to be done, based on thorough analysis during the incubation phase.

Michael believes that presenting a variety of prototypes, not just one, as potential solutions to the key jobs to be done is essential to generating excitement in the product owner. This helps them see the possibilities and feel empowered to explore different directions for the product, reinforcing their ownership and flexibility in taking the project forward.

Michael would measure the success of the handover by gathering both qualitative feedback from product owners and seeing if at least 20% of current product owners would want to switch over and take ownership of the incubated product. This combination would serve as a strong indicator of both excitement and product-market fit.

Michael is working on naming a team that defines strategy, where to play and how to win in a particular domain, sets and measures [[OKRs]], tracks weekly progress, and reports back to SteerCos and product review groups in digital. [[Portfolio Management]] is one name under consideration.
