# Methodologies & Frameworks

Michael wants to implement a methodology in his team focused on [[Myth-Busting]] in digital product development. This involves challenging assumptions related to desirability (user wants), usability (user life integration), viability (business value), and feasibility (technical possibility), with a particular emphasis on desirability and viability.

Michael plans to implement a performance management system focusing on the number of assumptions surfaced, tested, and either validated or rejected. The key metric will be the 'number of mythbusters.' The process will involve using [[Strategizer's Test Cards]], monthly team sessions to review test cards, weekly deep dives, one-on-ones to track progress, and a monthly celebration of the most successful tests to showcase and celebrate best practices.

Michael plans to focus on initial areas for demonstrating the value of the new [[Myth-Busting]] approach within their incubation processes, patient-centered solutions, and building products and APIs for partners.

Michael believes that implementing this methodology is the best way to introduce product thinking to senior stakeholders by showing concrete assumption testing. He anticipates potential resistance from those strongly attached to their assumptions and recognizes the need for political backing. He plans to secure support from his superiors and communicate upfront about the importance and necessity of this approach to manage expectations and avoid being perceived as no-sayers.
