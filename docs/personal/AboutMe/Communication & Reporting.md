# Communication & Reporting

Michael has decided to use the following sections for his weekly status updates to his boss: [[Gold Stars]] (wins and successes), [[Speed Bumps]] (fixable concerns), [[Red Alerts]] (serious issues requiring escalation), [[Brainwaves]] (new ideas and concepts), and [[Radar]] (upcoming events or potential future risks). He is now seeking advice on how to introduce this format to his boss in the first email, framing it as an experiment to gauge interest and usefulness.

## Communication Preferences
Michael prefers to use 'they' and 'them' rather than 'he' or 'she.'

Michael prefers to answer questions one at a time when having a conversation.
