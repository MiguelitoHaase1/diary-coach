# Product Management Philosophy

## Core Beliefs
Michael values structured thinking combined with a willingness to embrace quick, practical solutions.

Michael is reflecting on the key ideas from the '[[Product Sense]]' course, which emphasizes that the quality of thinking matters more than tools or process. The course encourages building a mental model through repeated practice and cognitive empathy, especially by understanding customer motivation. Michael wants to be coached through these reflections with one question at a time.

Michael likes to focus on the importance of [[Myth-Busting]] in digital product development, emphasizing desirability and viability.  

Michael believes that most digital ideas, even if they sound good, are actually wrong about 95% of the time. This mental model will be trained into individuals and teams, as well as senior stakeholders. The goal is to prove the value of testing assumptions by focusing on a few key areas, demonstrating, and showcasing the results.

## Organizational Design & Structure
Michael's proposed reorganization emphasizes '[[Singularly Responsible Individuals]]' who are full-stack and can manage scouting, strategy, data, and product responsibilities. This new structure focuses on organizing by [[OKRs]] and [[Outcomes vs Outputs|outcomes]], reducing handovers, and balancing buy vs. build approaches. The idea is to build the scaffolding (data infrastructure, core user experience) and buy the bricks (sub-experiences). The reorganization includes product managers for fields like data, a strong insights team, and a shift away from traditional program management and strategy roles. There will be a focus on achieving business outcomes rather than being organized by function.

Michael is proposing a new structure for digital product teams as part of a cost-cutting initiative. The new structure involves: 1. Strong tech leads who also take on project management and systems management responsibilities. 2. Strong product managers who also handle project management budgets and tasks typically done by product owners. 3. Line managers (organizational managers) taking a more hands-on, coaching role for developers, designers, and product owners, as individual coaching will decrease due to fewer project managers. 4. Core team structure that always includes a product manager, a tech lead, and a lead designer, with strong managers for developers as well.

Michael believes that line managers overseeing developers, product managers, or designers need to have direct experience in those fields to effectively manage their teams. These managers should have content expertise and not just be generic people managers. This might require different people or additional training to be hands-on managers with deep domain knowledge.

Michael believes that there are already people in place within the organization who fit the hands-on approach for line management. However, some of these individuals are not currently managers but should be, and part of the shift will involve identifying talent that can truly coach in this step.

Michael is preparing a sparring session with management to discuss [[T-shaped vs Semi-dedicated Teams|T-shaped vs semi-dedicated cross-functional teams]] and performance management of cross-functional team dynamics.
