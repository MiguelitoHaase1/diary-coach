# Digital Health Experience

Michael is thinking about [[Digital Health Strategies]] for a pharmaceutical company and has identified four key business outcomes for digital health initiatives: 
1. Capturing [[Real-World Evidence]] to complement clinical trial data for payer negotiations or regulator applications. 
2. Positioning for a [[Direct-to-Consumer (DTC)]] model as patients behave more like customers, bypassing healthcare professionals (HCPs). 
3. Collaborating with health systems to help them scale and deliver clinical-like products as medical devices or [[DTX]] (digital therapeutics), possibly to gain preference in partnerships. 
4. Increasing patient outcomes directly through DTX or [[SAMD]] (Software as a Medical Device) products, complementing doctors. 

He is seeking feedback to better understand the distinctions between these and to strengthen his strategic thinking around them.

Michael believes DTX and SAMD strategies are not viable due to regulatory hurdles and lack of incentives for doctors to push these tools. He favors a shift toward a more consumer-driven model or other digital tools outside heavy regulatory frameworks. He plans to address this in a memo later.

Michael is considering an approach to [[Type 2 Diabetes Management]] that emphasizes early intervention with [[GLP-1s]], exercise, and improved diet. He is interested in targeting individuals who are prediabetic or in the early stages of type 2 diabetes, offering a comprehensive solution to potentially reverse or manage the disease before it progresses.

Michael believes that achieving widespread coverage for [[GLP-1s]] and the associated regimen for prediabetics is crucial for early intervention in type 2 diabetes. He is considering the realism of this approach in terms of pricing and payer coverage.

Michael is considering the implications of his pharmaceutical company, which historically focuses on diabetes, expanding into the prediabetes space. He recognizes this would be a significant mindset shift, involving moving beyond treatment into early diagnosis and intervention.

Michael is considering whether his pharmaceutical company should focus more on remission from type 2 diabetes as a value proposition and explore how to achieve that for patients using their products.

Michael is working on an [[Opportunity Solution Tree]] related to side effects management for patients using [[GLP-1]] drugs, specifically focusing on managing nausea and vomiting.

Michael believes that high travel is essential for product owners in digital product teams in his pharmaceutical company because the make-or-break factor is getting buy-in from affiliates or regions. He believes affiliates need direct engagement with people deeply involved in the product's development. This connection allows both the product and the affiliates to influence each other, making it a 'contact sport' that's even more crucial with affiliates than with therapeutic areas. Affiliates invite product owners to drive conversations on PRB, MLR, go-to-market strategy, and growth tactics because they see the value in product owners being deeply knowledgeable about the product. This close relationship is what differentiates the company from consultancies or external agencies.
