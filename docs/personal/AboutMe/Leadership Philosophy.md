# Leadership Philosophy

## Leadership Approach
Michael wants to remember the leadership style he embodied during a successful [[McKinsey]] offsite in Indonesia as '[[Calm Clarity with Open Energy]].' This approach included inclusive listening, engaging presentation style, and a strong contrast to a more rigid or draining format, which resonated deeply with both his team and others.  

Michael sees speaking up in the leadership team as good behavior, offering critical views, but he might also be perceived as blending in too much or not making significant changes, potentially appearing more as a complainer rather than a solution provider.

Michael cultivated a positive and opportunity-focused culture within his team, fostering a sense of belonging despite organizational complexity and uncertainty.

Michael has been thinking ahead, advocating for aspirational ways of working to transform future strategies, but hasn't yet fully implemented these transformative changes at the execution level. He has navigated a significant organizational change, maintaining high energy and a strong product culture despite complexities and challenges for team members.

## Feedback & People Management
Michael values a product manager's ability to take someone else's mental model and work with it, rather than always creating their own. He believes this is important for fostering ownership and collaboration within the team. Michael appreciates a product manager's ability to embrace team collaboration, work closely with designers, business owners, and the insights lead, and incorporate others' ways and thoughts into their work. He values co-creation, engagement, and empowering others to feel a sense of ownership.

Michael values a product manager's empathy and awareness of others' feelings but notes that over-emphasis on others' emotions can sometimes feel invasive or reinforce negative feelings. He prefers a balance that respects boundaries and maintains a professional focus.

Michael is conducting a performance review of a product manager who has been with the company for four months. The product manager has built strong relationships with business owners and is seen as having a strong sense of ownership, focusing on patient and user engagement. He is considered a thought leader and prefers to drive processes himself. However, his presentation skills are lacking, making it hard to understand his direction. He tends to go down rabbit holes and communicate bottom-up, which makes it difficult for Michael to feel confident in his direction. Michael prefers a more [[Hypothesis-Driven Communication|hypothesis-driven, top-down communication approach]].

Michael is considering writing a rationale for providing a spot bonus to an employee named [[Daniel]] for performance that exceeds expectations. They plan to share this rationale with their management team as a pitch for the bonus.

Michael values recognizing small wins and practical achievements in product development, even in feature factory settings, acknowledging the importance of progress within the current reality. They believe in balancing visionary goals with recognition of day-to-day efforts.
