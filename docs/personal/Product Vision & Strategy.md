# Product Vision & Strategy

Michael's four key realms of discovery for his digital product incubation teams are:

1. [[Real-World Evidence]] creation via digital solutions to address payer needs for outcome-based healthcare models.

2. Real-world data for regulators to approve drugs with specific claims and manage the drug life cycle, including pharmacovigilance.

3. [[Wearables Integration]] to collect real-world data through CGMs and other devices, helping to advance payer and regulatory efforts.

4. [[Integrated Health Systems]], where digital products are closely aligned with healthcare providers like [[Mayo Clinic]] to track patient outcomes and integrate into their systems.

These four realms form the core of Michael's long-term vision for coordinated digital products.

Michael believes that wearables, particularly [[CGMs]], will become democratized, allowing even pre-patients to use them to track biometric data. He sees wearables companies potentially owning the patient life cycle, making it crucial for pharmaceutical companies to integrate with wearables to maintain relevance and avoid being commoditized. This is broader than just collecting real-world data for regulators and payers; it's also about staying competitive in the market.

Michael envisions co-developing products with major healthcare providers like [[Mayo Clinic]], where they collaborate to push EHRs and clinical systems to become more user-friendly. He sees it as essential for pharmaceutical companies to invest and partner in these efforts to remain key players in the evolving healthcare system.

Michael is considering setting up product teams with a trio (product manager, tech lead, lead designer) to build digital products for pharmaceutical companies that directly touch patients, HCPs, and payers, focusing particularly on scenarios that research and development teams would invest in rather than leaving it to the commercial part of the organization.
