# Market Strategy

## Core Principles

### Market Deepening Before Widening
"Achieve deep problem-solution fit in a niche before expanding market"

### Customer Conflicts Reveal Segmentation
"When different customer groups request contradictory features, identify underlying jobs-to-be-done and serve your core segment exceptionally well"

### Nail It Before Scale It
"Ensure to not scale too early -- it's easier to nail any tasks at small scale first"

## The Depth-First Approach

### Why Depth Wins
- Creates word-of-mouth in a community
- Builds deep expertise
- Generates passionate advocates
- Allows focused iteration
- Reduces resource spread

### The Widening Trap
- Trying to serve everyone poorly
- Features for edge cases
- Diluted value proposition
- Confused positioning
- Mediocre everything

## Customer Conflict as Insight

When customers disagree, it reveals:
1. **Different jobs-to-be-done** - They're hiring you for different reasons
2. **Market segments** - Natural boundaries exist
3. **Positioning opportunities** - Choose who to serve best
4. **Future products** - Each segment might need different solutions

## The Nail It Process

### Before Scaling
1. **Define success narrowly** - One segment, one job
2. **Go deep** - Understand every nuance
3. **Perfect the experience** - Make it exceptional
4. **Validate retention** - Ensure they stick
5. **Document the playbook** - What exactly works?

### Signs You've Nailed It
- High word-of-mouth referrals
- Low churn in target segment
- Feature requests align
- Clear value articulation
- Willing to pay premium

## Growth Strategy Progression

1. **Nail** → Deep excellence in one niche
2. **Expand** → Adjacent segments with similar jobs
3. **Platform** → Abstract common needs
4. **Ecosystem** → Enable others to serve segments
