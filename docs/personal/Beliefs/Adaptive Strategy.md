# Adaptive Strategy

## Definition

"Great product teams hold onto a clear vision and objectives of the strategy they've been given, but then they adapt/pivot it as they learn."

## Key Elements

### What Stays Constant
- Clear vision
- Core objectives
- Strategic intent
- Value proposition

### What Changes
- Tactics and approach
- Specific features
- Target segments
- Go-to-market strategy

## The Balance

Adaptive strategy requires:
- **Conviction** in the vision
- **Flexibility** in the execution
- **Humility** to change course
- **Courage** to persist through pivots

## Relationship to Other Concepts

This is the first step in the scientific method:
1. **Adaptive Strategy** (this) - Set direction but stay flexible
2. [[First Principle Thinking]] - Understand deeply before acting
3. [[The Scientific Method for Products]] - Test and validate

"Only after defining a strategy with a clear focus, can one prioritize where to apply first principle thinking"

## Examples at Jabra

- Pivoting from feature parity to differentiation ([[Stop Feature Parity Chase]])
- Adapting [[SAFe]] rather than wholesale replacement
- Focusing on specific verticals for [[Front-line Workers Business]]

## Anti-patterns

- Rigid adherence to initial plan
- Pivoting without learning
- Changing vision with every setback
- No clear strategy to adapt from
