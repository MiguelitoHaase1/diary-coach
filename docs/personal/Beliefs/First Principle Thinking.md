# First Principle Thinking

## Definition

"Great product teams don't solve problems by asking experts or drawing analogies. They go deep into truly dissecting the problem."

## What It Means

First principle thinking involves:
- Breaking down complex problems to fundamental truths
- Questioning every assumption
- Building up from basic principles
- Avoiding "because that's how it's done" reasoning

## Why It Matters

### Avoids
- Copying competitors blindly (the [[Catch-up Trap]])
- Inherited assumptions from past contexts
- Expert bias and outdated wisdom
- Surface-level solutions

### Enables
- True innovation
- Breakthrough insights
- Solving root causes
- Sustainable differentiation

## The Process

1. Identify the problem
2. Break down to fundamental components
3. Question each assumption
4. Rebuild from first principles
5. Validate the new approach

Use [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]] and [[Customer interview principles]] to question assumptions about customer needs and behaviors.

## Relationship to Strategy

"Only after thinking deeply, can one devise the right experiments to run"

This sits between:
- [[Adaptive Strategy]] (setting direction)
- [[The Scientific Method for Products]] (validation)

## Examples at Jabra

### Where Needed
- Why do we need [[SAFe]]? What problem does it solve?
- What do [[IT Admins]] actually need vs. what they ask for?
- Why is voice the future interface? ([[Voice as Keyboard Business]])

### Anti-Examples
- "[[Logitech]] has this feature, so we need it too"
- "We've always used [[SAFe]]"
- "[[Microsoft]] partnership is obviously the right choice"

## Questions to Ask

- What are we really trying to achieve?
- Why do we believe this is true?
- What if the opposite were true?
- What would we build if starting from scratch?
- What physics/economics/psychology governs this?

Apply [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] to understand the fundamental forces driving customer behavior, and use [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]] to dig past surface-level feature requests.
