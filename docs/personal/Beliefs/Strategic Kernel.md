# Strategic Kernel

## Core Principle

"Effective strategy consists of diagnosis, guiding policy, and coherent actions" - A good strategy isn't a vision or goals, but a cohesive response to an important challenge.

## The Three Components

### 1. Diagnosis
- Identifies the critical challenge
- Simplifies overwhelming complexity
- Names the core problem to solve
- Creates shared understanding

### 2. Guiding Policy
- Overall approach to overcome obstacles
- Channels action in certain directions
- Rules out other directions
- Creates advantage through focus

### 3. Coherent Actions
- Coordinated steps to carry out policy
- Resource allocation decisions
- Clear priorities and sequences
- Measurable implementations

## Why Most Strategies Fail

They lack one or more components:
- **No diagnosis** - Jump to solutions without understanding problem
- **No guiding policy** - List of goals without approach
- **No coherent actions** - Strategy without execution plan
- **No coherence** - Actions don't reinforce each other

## Connection to Product Strategy

"A good strategy has 3 things":
1. **Positioning** - The job-to-be-done (diagnosis)
2. **Segmentation** - Who to focus on (guiding policy)
3. **Differentiation** - How to win (coherent actions)

## The Power of Focus

Good strategy requires saying NO:
- Can't be everything to everyone
- Resources are always limited
- Focus creates competitive advantage
- Coherence requires tradeoffs

## Application Method

1. **Diagnose deeply** using [[First Principle Thinking]]
2. **Identify [[The Crux]]** - the key challenge
3. **Create guiding policy** that addresses the crux
4. **Design coherent actions** that reinforce each other
5. **Write it down** - clarity comes from writing

## Strategic Complements

### Hedgehog Strategy
Focus on the intersection of:
- What you're best at
- What drives your economics
- What you're passionate about

### Strategic Inflection Points
- 10X changes require new diagnosis
- Old strategies become obsolete
- Need new kernel for new reality
