# Customer Discovery Principles

## Core Belief

Continuous customer contact is the lifeblood of great products. Without it, teams drift into building what they think customers want rather than what customers actually need.

## Key Practices

### Weekly Customer Interviews
- Conduct weekly customer interviews to maintain constant learning
- Prevents market drift and assumption buildup
- Creates organizational muscle memory for customer empathy
- Use [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]] for tactical guidance
- Apply [[Customer interview principles]] for effective conversations

### The Mom Test
- Get reliable feedback by asking about actual experiences in the past
- Never ask hypothetical questions about the future
- Focus on specific behaviors, not opinions
- Implemented through [[Customer interview principles]]
- Specific questions in [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]]

### Switch Interviews
- Interview users who switched TO your product (why they chose you)
- Interview users who switched FROM your product (why they left)
- Interview users of competitors who almost switched (why they didn't)
- These moments reveal the most honest insights
- Maps to [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] four forces framework

### Path Dependent Software
- Software development is path-dependent
- Plan thoroughly before V1, as complete pivots are difficult
- Early decisions constrain future possibilities
- Architecture choices have long-lasting impacts

## Discovery Framework

Product Discovery must address four risks:
1. **Desirability** - Do customers want it?
2. **Usability** - Can they use it effectively?
3. **Feasibility** - Can we build it?
4. **Business Viability** - Is it good for our business?

## Anti-Patterns

- Asking "Would you use this feature?"
- Showing mockups and asking for opinions
- Only talking to happy customers
- Letting sales filter customer feedback
- Quarterly customer check-ins (too infrequent)

## Manual Onboarding Principle

"Onboard manually (at first)" because it:
- Frees engineering to focus on core product
- Builds brand through personal touch
- Fosters user-centric culture
- Provides rich learning opportunities

## Connection to Strategy

- Supports [[Jobs To Be Done]] understanding
- Enables [[Adaptive Strategy]] through continuous learning
- Feeds [[The Scientific Method for Products]]
- Prevents the [[Feature Parity Trap]]
- Operationalized through [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]]
- Guided by [[Customer interview principles]]
- Uses [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] to understand decision dynamics
