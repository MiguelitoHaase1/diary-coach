# The Scientific Method for Products

## Definition

"Great product teams put their assumptions, hypotheses, and beliefs to the test."

## The Product Science Process

1. **Observe** - Gather data about users and market
2. **Hypothesize** - Form testable predictions
3. **Experiment** - Design minimal tests
4. **Measure** - Collect objective data
5. **Conclude** - Accept, reject, or refine hypothesis
6. **Iterate** - Apply learnings to next cycle

## Key Principles

### Rigorous Testing
- Every belief must be validated
- Opinions are just untested hypotheses
- Data trumps intuition
- Failed experiments are valuable

### Minimal Viable Experiments
- Test core assumptions first
- Smallest possible validation
- Fast feedback loops
- Low cost of failure
- "Test assumptions, not products" - it's faster and easier
- Use [[The Mom Test]] - ask about actual past experiences, not hypothetical futures
- Conduct [[Switch Interviews]] - tremendous insight from users who switched to/from your product
- Apply [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]] for structured inquiry
- Follow [[Customer interview principles]] for reliable data
- Use [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] to test purchase decision hypotheses

## The Cycle Completion

"Only after running experiments that challenge assumptions can one pivot the strategy to comply with the real world"

This creates a loop:
1. [[Adaptive Strategy]] → 
2. [[First Principle Thinking]] → 
3. **Scientific Method** (this) →
4. Back to Adaptive Strategy

## Application at Jabra

### Current Hypotheses to Test
- [[Stop Feature Parity Chase]]
- [[Front-line Worker Vertical Focus]]
- [[Voice-First Knowledge Work]]
- [[Transform Away from SAFe]]
- [[Multi-Stakeholder Product Strategy]]
- [[Platform Agnostic AI Strategy]]

### How to Run Experiments
- Start with highest-risk assumptions
- Define clear success metrics
- Set time bounds
- Plan for both success and failure
- Document learnings religiously

## Common Mistakes

- Testing solutions, not problems
- Confirmation bias in experiment design
- Ignoring negative results
- Not testing core assumptions
- Over-investing before validation

## Tools and Methods

- A/B testing
- Design partnerships
- Pilot programs
- Prototype testing
- Win/loss analysis
- Customer interviews using [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]]
- [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] force analysis
- [[Customer interview principles]] for data collection

## Connection to Other Beliefs

- Enables [[Customer Discovery Principles]]
- Supports [[Market Strategy]] validation
- Requires [[Above vs Below the Line]] openness to failure
- Drives [[10X Thinking]] through rapid iteration
- Builds on [[Jobs To Be Done]] insights
