# Above vs Below the Line

## Core Principle

Leaders recognize and choose responses from open/curious states (above the line) vs. closed/defensive states (below the line). This awareness enables conscious choice in how we show up.

## The Two States

### Above the Line ✓
- Open and curious
- Learning-oriented
- Taking responsibility
- Seeking solutions
- Collaborative mindset
- "How can I contribute?"

### Below the Line ✗
- Closed and defensive
- Being right-oriented
- Blaming others/circumstances
- Protecting ego
- Competitive mindset
- "Why is this happening to me?"

## The Power of Awareness

The key insight: **You can't change what you're not aware of**
1. Notice when you're below the line
2. Accept it without judgment
3. Choose to shift above the line
4. Take action from curiosity

## Practical Shifts

### From Below → Above
- Blame → Responsibility: "What's my part in this?"
- Defensiveness → Curiosity: "What can I learn?"
- Scarcity → Abundance: "How can we all win?"
- Control → Trust: "What wants to emerge?"
- Drama → Empowerment: "What's possible here?"

## Connection to Leadership

### The Observer Self
"You are the awareness watching your thoughts, enabling choice in responses"
- Creates space between stimulus and response
- Allows conscious choice
- Prevents reactive patterns
- Enables true leadership

### Radical Responsibility
Leaders own their contributions to all circumstances:
- No blame, even when others are "wrong"
- Focus on what you can control
- Model the behavior you want
- Create psychological safety

## Team Dynamics

When leaders operate above the line:
- Teams feel safer to take risks
- Innovation increases
- Conflicts become productive
- Trust deepens
- Performance improves

## Shifting Techniques

1. **Pause and breathe** - Create space
2. **Name it** - "I notice I'm below the line"
3. **Get curious** - "What am I defending?"
4. **Choose differently** - "How do I want to show up?"
5. **Appreciate** - Find something to value
