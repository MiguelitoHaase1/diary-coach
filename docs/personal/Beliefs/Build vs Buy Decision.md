# Build vs Buy Decision

## Core Principle

"Software differentiating your business should be built, not bought"

## The Decision Framework

### Build When:
- The capability is core to your competitive advantage
- It directly impacts customer experience
- You need deep customization and control
- It's part of your unique value proposition
- You have the expertise to maintain it

### Buy When:
- It's a commodity capability (email, payments, analytics)
- Someone else does it significantly better
- It's not core to your differentiation
- Total cost of ownership favors purchasing
- You lack domain expertise

## Why This Matters

The build vs buy decision determines:
- Where you invest engineering resources
- What capabilities you can iterate quickly
- How much control you have over your product
- Your ability to differentiate

## Modern Context

With [[AI and Software Design]], this principle becomes even more critical:
- AI makes building easier, lowering the bar for "build"
- But design and architecture become the key skills
- Custom software can now be built faster
- Integration and maintenance still require consideration

## Application Strategy

1. **Identify your differentiation** - What makes you unique?
2. **Map capabilities** - Core vs. commodity
3. **Assess resources** - Do you have the skills?
4. **Consider total cost** - Not just initial, but ongoing
5. **Plan for scale** - Will this decision scale with growth?
