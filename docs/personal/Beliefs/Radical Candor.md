# Radical Candor

## Core Principle

"Care Personally, Challenge Directly" - The foundation of high-performing teams is the ability to combine genuine personal care with direct, honest feedback.

## The 2x2 Framework

### Radical Candor (Care + Challenge) âœ“
- Give direct feedback because you care
- Challenge ideas while supporting the person
- Build trust through honest communication

### Ruinous Empathy (Care without Challenge)
- Being "nice" but not helpful
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Protecting feelings over growth

### Obnoxious Aggression (Challenge without Care)
- Being brutally honest without empathy
- Focusing on being right over being effective
- Damaging relationships for "truth"

### Manipulative Insincerity (Neither Care nor Challenge)
- Political maneuvering
- Passive-aggressive behavior
- Saying what's expedient
