# Scientist vs Factory Manager Mindset

## Core Philosophy

Because of the [[Product Management Power Law]], product managers need to adopt the mental model of a **Scientist**, not a Factory floor manager.

## The Difference

### Factory Manager Mindset ❌
- Focus on delivery-on-time
- Predictable outputs
- Following the plan
- Minimizing variance
- Success = shipping on schedule

### Scientist Mindset ✅
- Focus on fast adoption of learnings
- Experimental approach
- Adapting based on evidence
- Embracing uncertainty
- Success = validated learning

Implemented through [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]], [[Customer interview principles]], and [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]].

## Why Most Fail

"That's where most people fail in software" - they apply factory thinking to a domain governed by power laws and uncertainty.

## The Three Pillars

Working like a scientist means doing 3 things well:
1. [[Adaptive Strategy]] - Pivot based on learnings
2. [[First Principle Thinking]] - Deep problem understanding
3. [[The Scientific Method for Products]] - Rigorous experimentation

## Application at Jabra

This mindset is especially critical given:
- [[SAFe]] encourages factory thinking
- Need to escape the [[Catch-up Trap]]
- Uncertainty in new markets like [[Front-line Workers Business]]

Operationalize this through:
- Regular use of [[Jabra/flashcards/Customer Discovery Questions]]
- Following [[Customer interview principles]]
- Applying [[Demand-Side Sales Methodology]] to understand market forces

## Connection to Other Beliefs

- Enables [[Outcome Over Output]] thinking
- Requires [[10X Thinking]] ambition
- Drives [[DORA Metrics]] improvement
- Supports [[Market Strategy]] through experimentation
