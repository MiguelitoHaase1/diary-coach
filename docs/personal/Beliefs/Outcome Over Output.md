# Outcome Over Output

## Core Principle

"Outcomes > Output" - Measure teams by business outcomes achieved, not features shipped or velocity metrics. This is one of the four key principles for product excellence.

## The Four Principles of Product Excellence

Product excellence requires putting the right things first:
1. **Outcomes > Output** (this)
2. **Empowerment > Action**
3. **Insight > Execution**
4. **Simulation > Procedural Logic**

## Why Outcomes Matter More

### Output Focus (Wrong)
- Number of features shipped
- Story points completed
- Lines of code written
- Tickets closed
- Release frequency

### Outcome Focus (Right)
- Customer problems solved
- Business metrics improved
- User behavior changed
- Market share gained
- Revenue generated

## The Shift Required

Moving from output to outcome requires:
- Clear definition of success metrics
- Direct connection to customer value
- Empowered teams that own outcomes
- Leadership that tolerates ambiguity
- Systems that reward impact over activity

## Practical Application

### For Teams
- Start with the outcome, work backward to features
- Measure success by behavior change
- Kill features that don't drive outcomes
- Celebrate metric improvements, not launches

### For Leaders
- Set outcome-based OKRs
- Fund outcomes, not projects
- Ask "What changed for customers?"
- Reward outcome achievement

## Anti-Patterns

- Celebrating feature launches without usage data
