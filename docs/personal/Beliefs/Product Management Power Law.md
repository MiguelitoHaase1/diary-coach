# Product Management Power Law

## The Inconvenient Truth

There's a depressing power law to digital products:
- **95% of digital ideas won't work** (even if they sound good)
- Even the **5% that could work** will need several iterations to provide desired outcomes
- This mental model should be trained into individuals, teams, and senior stakeholders

## Implications

This power law fundamentally changes how we should approach product management:
- Success is rare and requires persistence
- Most attempts will fail - this is normal, not exceptional
- Even good ideas need multiple iterations
- The key is learning speed, not initial correctness

## Why This Matters

Because of this reality, product managers must:
- Embrace failure as information
- Focus on rapid learning cycles
- Avoid over-investing in unvalidated ideas
- Build systems for quick iteration
