# Jobs To Be Done

## Core Principle

Customers "hire" products to solve concrete functional, emotional, and social struggles in their lives. This fundamental insight drives how we think about product development.

## Key Components

### Functional Jobs
- The practical task the customer wants to accomplish
- The measurable outcome they seek
- The problem they're trying to solve

### Emotional Jobs
- How customers want to feel
- The anxieties they want to avoid
- The confidence they seek

### Social Jobs
- How customers want to be perceived by others
- The status they want to achieve
- The tribal identity they seek

## Why This Matters

Understanding Jobs To Be Done helps us:
- Move beyond feature lists to actual customer needs
- Design solutions that address root causes
- Create products people actually "hire"
- Avoid the [[Feature Parity Trap]]

## Application Principles

- **No to target groups/personas** - Group customers by situations, not demographics
- **Story-Driven Product Development** - Develop products around emotionally resonant narratives
- **What is a 'product'** - A product is defined by its customer focus and value creation, not internal features
