## Key Learning Moments

### 1. LLM Prompt Engineering
**Challenge**: Creating consistent behavioral analysis across different conversation contexts  
**Solution**: Structured JSON prompting with explicit scoring rubrics and context injection  
**Learning**: Clear constraints and examples in prompts dramatically improve consistency

### 2. Realistic Persona Design
**Challenge**: Creating authentic PM resistance patterns that feel realistic  
**Solution**: Based personas on actual behavioral patterns with dynamic resistance levels  
**Learning**: Authenticity requires variability and evolution, not scripted responses

### 3. Performance Integration
**Challenge**: Balancing behavioral analysis with response speed requirements  
**Solution**: Async tracking with non-blocking performance measurement  
**Learning**: Performance monitoring should be invisible to user experience

### 4. Test-Driven Complex Systems
**Challenge**: Testing LLM-integrated systems with external dependencies  
**Solution**: Comprehensive mocking with realistic response simulation  
**Learning**: Good mocks enable testing of complex AI systems without external dependencies
