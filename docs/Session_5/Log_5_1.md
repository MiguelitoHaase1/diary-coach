## Commands for Progress Verification

```bash
# Verify all Session 5 tests pass
pytest tests/test_agent_interface.py tests/test_langgraph_state.py tests/test_coach_node.py tests/test_langsmith_metrics.py -v

# Check interface compliance
python -c "from src.orchestration.agent_interface import AgentFactory; print('âœ… Factory operational')"

# Verify state management
python -c "from src.orchestration.state import ConversationState; print('âœ… State schema ready')"

# Test coach node wrapping
python -c "from src.orchestration.coach_node import CoachNode; print('âœ… Coach node ready')"

# Check LangSmith integration
python -c "from src.orchestration.langsmith_tracker import LangSmithTracker; print('âœ… LangSmith tracker ready')"
```

## Session Mantra Validated

**"Wrap, don't weld. Measure everything. Migrate gradually."**

- âœ… **Wrap**: Interface abstraction preserves existing functionality
- âœ… **Measure**: LangSmith integration provides comprehensive metrics
- âœ… **Migrate**: Foundation ready for parallel system operation

The LangGraph migration infrastructure is operational. User experience remains unchanged while system gains enhanced observability and state management capabilities. Ready to proceed with checkpoint persistence and parallel validation.
