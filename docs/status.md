2. ✅ **Continuous Improvement**: The TDD approach enables measurable quality improvement
3. ✅ **Learning While Building**: Documentation artifacts (logbooks, dojo exercises) capture knowledge for continuous learning
4. ✅ **Interface-First Design**: Early definition of interfaces enables infrastructure evolution without breaking changes
5. ✅ **Code Quality**: Automated linting ensures consistent, readable code
6. ✅ **Parallel Development**: Git worktrees enable simultaneous feature development

## Development Workflow with Worktrees

cd worktrees/ui
npm install  # If using Node.js for frontend
# Develop UI on feature/ui-interface branch

# Switch between features without stashing
cd worktrees/mcp
# Continue MCP enhancements
```
