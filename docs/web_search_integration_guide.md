# Web Search Integration Guide

## Overview

The Web Search Agent is now integrated into the multi-agent coaching system. When you say "deep report" at the end of a coaching session, the system will:

1. **Generate Deep Thoughts Report** (Reporter Agent)
2. **Extract Themes** from the recommendations section
3. **Search for Articles** (Web Search Agent) 
4. **Enhance Report** with article recommendations

## How It Works

### Stage 3 Flow (Deep Report Generation)

```
User says "deep report"
    ‚Üì
1. Reporter Agent generates Deep Thoughts
    ‚Üì
2. System extracts themes from "Recommended readings" section
    ‚Üì
3. Web Search Agent searches for articles on those themes
    ‚Üì
4. Report is enhanced with article recommendations
    ‚Üì
5. Final report saved with real article suggestions
```

### The Web Search Agent

- **Location**: `src/agents/web_search_agent.py`
- **Prompt**: `src/agents/prompts/web_search_agent_prompt.md`
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Intelligent query formulation
  - Quality filtering of sources
  - Article summarization
  - Theme extraction

### Integration Points

1. **Multi-Agent CLI** (`src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py`):
   - Initializes Web Search Agent
   - Calls it after Reporter Agent
   - Enhances report with results

2. **Agent Communication**:
   - Uses standard `AgentRequest`/`AgentResponse` pattern
   - Themes passed in context
   - Results returned as formatted markdown

## Current Implementation

The Web Search Agent currently:
- ‚úÖ Accepts themes from Deep Thoughts reports
- ‚úÖ Formulates effective search strategies
- ‚úÖ Suggests high-quality sources (HBR, Atlantic, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Provides article recommendations in proper format
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Returns suggestions (not real URLs yet)

## To Enable Real Web Search

To get actual articles with real URLs, you need one of:

1. **Web Search API Integration**:
   ```python
   # In web_search_agent.py, replace LLM call with:
   results = await search_api.search(query)
   ```

2. **Claude with WebSearch Access**:
   - When Claude runs the enhancement script
   - Claude can use WebSearch tool for real articles

3. **MCP Server with Web Access**:
   - Use Firecrawl or similar MCP server
   - Already have FIRECRAWL_API_KEY in .env

## Usage

### Automatic (End of Session)

```
User: deep report

System: 
  üìù Reporter Agent synthesizing insights...
  üîç Web Search Agent finding relevant articles...
  ‚úÖ Deep Thoughts report generated successfully!
```

### Manual Enhancement

If you have an existing Deep Thoughts report:

```bash
# Have Claude enhance it with real searches
python scripts/enhance_report_with_real_search.py docs/prototype/DeepThoughts/DeepThoughts_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.md
```

## Example Output

The enhanced Deep Thoughts report will include:

```markdown
