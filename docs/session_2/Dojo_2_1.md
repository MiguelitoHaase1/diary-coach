# Dojo Session 2.1: Production-Ready Async API Integration

**Purpose**: Enable me to copy this learning theme into Claude.ai, so I can personally prompt it further to teach me more about building production-ready async API integration patterns.

**Context**: We built a complete async wrapper around the Anthropic API that handles real-world production concerns: retry logic, cost tracking, error isolation, and graceful degradation. This wasn't just a simple API call - we built a service layer that could handle the unpredictability of external APIs while maintaining system reliability.

**Challenge**: The core problem we solved was transforming unreliable external API calls into a dependable service layer. External APIs fail, get rate limited, return unexpected responses, and change their models without notice. Our LLM service needed to absorb all this chaos and present a clean, predictable interface to the rest of our system.

**Concept**: **Async Service Layer Design with Resilience Patterns** - This is the practice of wrapping external dependencies in well-designed service layers that handle the "unknown unknowns" of production systems. The key insight is that the service layer becomes a translation boundary: external chaos gets converted into predictable internal behavior.

Why this matters to me as a product manager who codes: Understanding async service patterns helps me make better architectural decisions about reliability vs. performance tradeoffs. When I'm evaluating technical approaches or discussing system design with engineers, I can speak knowledgeably about why certain patterns (like retry logic, circuit breakers, and cost tracking) are essential for production systems. This knowledge translates directly to better product decisions about user experience during outages, cost management for API-heavy features, and realistic timeline estimates for integrating with external services.

The deeper principle here is **defensive programming against external dependencies**. Every external service will eventually fail in ways you didn't anticipate. Building resilience patterns upfront isn't just good engineering - it's good product management because it prevents user-facing failures and gives you observability into what's actually happening with your dependencies.

**Other areas one could explore**: 
- **Circuit breaker patterns** for handling cascading failures when APIs go down
- **Async queue patterns** for handling high-volume API calls without blocking user interactions  
- **Cost-aware API design** for building features that scale economically with usage patterns
