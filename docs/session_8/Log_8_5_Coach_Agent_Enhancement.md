# Session 8 - Increment 5: Coach Agent Enhancement

## Objective
Enable coach to autonomously call other agents during Stage 1 conversations.

## Implementation Summary

### Key Components Created

#### 1. Enhanced Coach Agent (`src/agents/enhanced_coach_agent.py`)
A new coach implementation that can call other agents during conversations:

**Core Features**:
- Inherits from BaseAgent with CONVERSATION capability
- Can autonomously call Memory, Personal Content, and MCP agents
- Intelligent trigger detection for when to call each agent
- Natural integration of agent responses into coaching
- Rate limiting (max 2 agent calls per turn)
- Recent call tracking to prevent repetitive queries

**Agent Calling Logic**:
- **Memory Agent**: Triggered by "remember when", "last time", "previously"
- **Personal Content**: Triggered by "belief", "value", "philosophy"
- **MCP Agent**: Triggered by "task", "todo", "priority", "what to do"
- **No calls**: During emotional processing or natural flow

**Integration Pattern**:
```python
# 1. Detect need for context
# 2. Call relevant agents (max 2 per turn)
# 3. Enhance system prompt with context
# 4. Generate natural coaching response
# 5. Track calls and clear periodically
```

#### 2. Coach Agent Context Enhancement
Created `src/agents/prompts/coach_agent_context.md`:
- Documents available agents and their capabilities
- Provides guidelines for when to call agents
- Examples of natural context integration
- Maintains non-directive coaching approach

#### 3. Multi-Agent CLI
Created `src/interface/multi_agent_cli.py`:
- Initializes all agents at startup
- Shows agent consultation in real-time
- Provides clear status updates
- Maintains conversation save functionality

#### 4. Comprehensive Test Suite
Created 12 tests covering:
- Agent trigger detection
- Call success and failure handling
- Context gathering with multiple triggers
- Prompt enhancement with agent data
- Call limit enforcement
- Recent call clearing
- Emotional content handling (no calls)
- Request format conversion

### Design Decisions

1. **Autonomous Calling**: Coach decides when to call agents based on conversation
2. **Natural Integration**: Context woven into questions, not data dumps
3. **Rate Limiting**: Max 2 calls per turn prevents overwhelming
4. **Periodic Clearing**: Recent calls cleared every 3 exchanges
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Failed agent calls don't break conversation

### Test Results
- âœ… All 12 Enhanced Coach tests passing
- âœ… Natural trigger detection working
- âœ… Rate limiting enforced
- âœ… Context integration seamless

## Code Quality
- Clean separation between base and enhanced coach
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clear logging for debugging
- Type hints throughout

## Integration Example

User: "Remember when we discussed priorities? What should I focus on today?"

Coach internally:
1. Detects "remember when" â†’ calls Memory Agent
2. Detects "focus on today" â†’ calls MCP Agent
3. Gets context from both agents
4. Enhances prompt with past discussion + current tasks
5. Generates: "I see you have Q4 planning marked high priority, which connects to the delegation challenges you mentioned last week. What aspect of the planning feels most tied to those delegation concerns?"

## Next Steps
Ready for testing the full multi-agent system:
- All agents integrated and working
- Coach can naturally access context
- Stage 1 exploration phase complete

## Human Tasks
ðŸ”´ **HUMAN SETUP REQUIRED**:
- [x] Verified all tests passing
- [ ] Run `python -m src.interface.multi_agent_cli` to test
- [ ] Have a conversation referencing past discussions
- [ ] Ask about tasks and priorities
- [ ] Discuss values or beliefs
- [ ] Observe how naturally the coach integrates context
- [ ] Verify agents are called appropriately (shown in CLI)
