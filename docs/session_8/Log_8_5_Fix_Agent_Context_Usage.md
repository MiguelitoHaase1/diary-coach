# Session 8 - Increment 5: Fix - Agent Context Usage

## Problem Identified

The enhanced coach was calling agents correctly but the LLM was ignoring the provided context and generating mock data like "call mom" and "dry cleaning" instead of using real Todoist tasks.

## Root Cause

The context injection was too subtle. The coach's non-directive philosophy was preventing it from directly referencing the provided data even when explicitly asked.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Context Prominence
Modified `_enhance_prompt_with_context` to make agent data more prominent:
```python
"## IMPORTANT: Current Context from Agents\n\n"
"{context_block}\n\n"
"## Context Usage Instructions:\n"
"- When user asks 'what should I work on' or about tasks: "
"Reference the ACTUAL tasks above, not examples\n"
"- When user asks about beliefs/values: Use the ACTUAL personal "
"context above\n"
"- Integrate this real data naturally into your coaching questions\n"
"- NEVER make up example tasks or beliefs when real data is provided"
```

### 2. Updated Coach Context Prompt
Added explicit instructions in `coach_agent_context.md`:
```markdown
### CRITICAL: Direct Question Handling

When the user asks DIRECT questions about their tasks, beliefs, or past conversations:
- DO reference the ACTUAL data provided by agents
- DON'T make up example tasks like "call mom" or "gym session"
- DON'T provide generic responses when specific data is available

For example:
- User: "What are my todos?" → Use the ACTUAL task list from MCP Agent
- User: "What are my core beliefs?" → Use the ACTUAL beliefs from Personal Content Agent
```

## Test Results

Created test script that confirmed fixes work:

**Test 1: Direct todo question**
- Question: "What are my todos for today?"
- Response: "You currently have one high-priority task: **Claude.md**, which is due on July 28, 2025."
- ✅ SUCCESS: Coach referenced real task!

**Test 2: Direct beliefs question**
- Question: "What are my core beliefs?"
- Response: Referenced actual beliefs about "go slow to go fast" and software architecture
- ✅ SUCCESS: Coach referenced real beliefs!

## Final Status

✅ **Enhanced coach now properly uses agent context**
✅ **Direct questions get direct answers with real data**
✅ **Non-directive coaching maintained for exploration**
✅ **No more mock data generation**

## How to Run

```bash
# Run the multi-agent system
python run_multi_agent.py

# Or directly
python -m src.interface.multi_agent_cli
```

The system will:
1. Initialize all agents (Memory, Personal Content, MCP)
2. Show when agents are consulted
3. Use real data in responses
4. Save conversations on stop

## Key Learning

The LLM needs explicit, prominent instructions to override its tendency to generate example data. Subtle context injection isn't enough - you need clear directives about using the PROVIDED data, especially for models trained on generic coaching examples.
