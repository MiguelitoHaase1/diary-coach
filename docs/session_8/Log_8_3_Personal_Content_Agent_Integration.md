# Session 8 - Increment 3: Personal Content Agent Integration

## Objective
Leverage Session 6's personal context system as a dedicated agent.

## Implementation Summary

### Key Components Created

#### 1. PersonalContentAgent (`src/agents/personal_content_agent.py`)
A comprehensive agent that wraps the existing MarkdownDocumentLoader from Session 6:

**Core Features**:
- Wraps MarkdownDocumentLoader for document loading and relevance scoring
- Provides structured responses for LangGraph integration
- Supports natural language queries about personal beliefs, experiences, and goals
- Returns formatted content with integration suggestions
- Handles missing or empty directories gracefully

**Response Format**:
```
RELEVANT CONTEXT:
- [Key insights from personal docs]
- [Related beliefs or experiences]
- [Connections to current discussion]

SUGGESTED INTEGRATION:
[Guidance on how to naturally weave this into conversation]
```

**Design Decisions**:
1. **Reuse Session 6 Infrastructure**: Leverages existing MarkdownDocumentLoader
2. **Structured Output**: Follows BaseAgent response format for consistency
3. **Integration Suggestions**: Provides hints for natural conversation flow
4. **Relevance Preservation**: Uses document loader's sophisticated scoring

#### 2. Personal Content Agent Prompt
Created `src/agents/prompts/personal_content_agent_prompt.md` defining:
- Agent's role and capabilities
- Document access scope (`/docs/personal/`)
- Response structure requirements
- Guidelines for maintaining user voice and sensitivity

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
Created 10 unit tests covering:
- Agent initialization and document discovery
- Core belief extraction
- Past experience retrieval
- Goal and aspiration queries
- Empty content handling
- Structured response format validation
- Missing directory handling
- Metadata tracking
- Integration suggestion variations

#### 4. Integration Tests
Created 4 integration tests verifying:
- Multi-agent state integration
- Coach â†’ Personal Content Agent communication
- Relevance scoring effectiveness
- Empty content handling in system context

### Architecture Integration

The PersonalContentAgent seamlessly integrates with the multi-agent system:
- Implements BaseAgent interface with PERSONAL_CONTEXT capability
- Uses AgentRequest/AgentResponse for structured communication
- Stores results in MultiAgentState's `personal_context` field
- Maintains Session 6's relevance scoring algorithms

### Test Results
- âœ… All 10 Personal Content Agent tests passing
- âœ… All 4 integration tests passing
- âœ… All 33 agent tests passing (system-wide)
- âœ… No linting issues

### Key Improvements
1. **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Structured request/response format
2. **LangGraph Compatibility**: State-based context storage
3. **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing documents
4. **Maintainability**: Reuses proven Session 6 infrastructure

## Code Quality
- Comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- 88-character line limit maintained
- Clean separation of concerns
- Robust error handling

## Next Steps
Ready for Increment 4: MCP Agent - Todoist Only
- Will build on Session 6's MCP client fixes
- Focus solely on Todoist integration
- Provide unified interface to other agents

## Human Tasks
ðŸ”´ **HUMAN SETUP REQUIRED**:
- [x] Verified agent tests passing
- [ ] Find out where the prompt for this agent is - and improve it
- [ ] Create meaningful personal documents in `/docs/personal/`
- [ ] Test with real personal content queries
- [ ] Verify coach references personal content naturally
