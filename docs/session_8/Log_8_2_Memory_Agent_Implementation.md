# Session 8 - Increment 2: Memory Agent Implementation

## Objective
Pre-load conversation context before coaching begins with a dedicated Memory Agent.

## Implementation Summary

### Key Components Created

#### 1. MemoryAgent (`src/agents/memory_agent.py`)
A comprehensive agent that loads and analyzes past conversations:

**Core Features**:
- Loads conversations from `data/conversations/` directory
- Extracts patterns: challenges, values, topics, and emotions
- Searches conversations based on natural queries
- Provides summaries and pattern analysis
- Handles various query types:
  - "remember when..." â†’ specific memory search
  - "patterns" â†’ conversation pattern analysis
  - "summary" â†’ overall conversation summary
  - General queries â†’ relevance-based search

**Pattern Extraction**:
- **Challenges**: problem, challenge, issue, struggle, difficult, organize, focus, productivity, clarity
- **Values**: value, believe, important, matter, care, purpose, meaning, growth, authenticity
- **Emotions**: feel, feeling, anxious, worried, excited, happy, frustrated, overwhelmed, confident
- **Topics**: 2-word phrases extracted from conversations

**Search Algorithm**:
- Extracts key terms (4+ characters) from queries
- Scores conversations by term matches
- Returns top 5 most relevant conversations
- Includes matching message snippets

#### 2. Test Suite
Created 10 comprehensive tests covering:
- Initialization and conversation loading
- Pattern extraction functionality
- Specific memory finding
- General conversation search
- Pattern analysis requests
- Summary generation
- Empty directory handling
- Malformed file handling
- Error handling

#### 3. Integration Tests
Created 4 integration tests verifying:
- Coach â†’ Memory Agent request handling
- Multi-agent state integration
- Context storage in state
- Graceful handling of empty history

### Design Decisions

1. **JSON Storage Format**: Conversations stored as JSON for easy parsing and compatibility
2. **Pre-loading Strategy**: All conversations loaded at initialization for fast access
3. **Pattern Caching**: Patterns extracted once and cached for performance
4. **Flexible Query Handling**: Natural language queries mapped to specific search types
5. **Relevance Scoring**: Simple but effective term-matching algorithm

### Linting Workflow Improvement
Updated CLAUDE.md to enforce linting immediately after file creation/modification:
- Run `python -m flake8` after EVERY file change
- Fix issues before running tests
- Added specific linting workflow section with common fixes

### Test Results
- âœ… All 10 Memory Agent tests passing
- âœ… All 4 integration tests passing
- âœ… All 23 agent tests still passing
- âœ… No linting issues

### Old Test Handling
The existing `test_memory_recall.py` and `test_memory_recall_integration.py` files reference an old `MemoryRecallNode` system that's being replaced by the new multi-agent architecture. These tests are now obsolete.

## Code Quality
- Followed new linting workflow - lint immediately after file creation
- All code passes flake8 with 88-character line limit
- Comprehensive docstrings and type hints
- Clean separation of concerns

## Next Steps
Ready for Increment 3: Personal Content Agent Integration
- Will leverage existing Session 6 personal context system
- Wrap PersonalContextNode into agent interface
- Use established relevance scoring

## Human Tasks
ðŸ”´ **HUMAN SETUP REQUIRED**:
- [x] Create some test conversation files in `data/conversations/` âœ…
- [x] Format: JSON with conversation_id, timestamp, and messages array âœ…
- [x] Test with "remember when..." queries to verify memory retrieval âœ…
- [ ] Find out where the prompt for this agent is - and improve it

## Session Completion Updates

### Conversation Saving Implemented âœ…
- Enhanced CLI now automatically saves conversations on stop command
- Saves to `data/conversations/` with ISO timestamp format
- Includes all messages with timestamps and metadata

### DeepThoughts Import Completed âœ…
- Created extraction script to convert DeepThoughts markdown to conversation JSON
- Successfully extracted 2 conversations from 20 files (others lack transcripts)
- Handles legacy format gracefully without errors

### Memory Agent Verified âœ…
- Tested with real conversation data
- All 4 test scenarios passed:
  - âœ… Remember specific architecture discussions
  - âœ… Extract conversation patterns
  - âœ… Generate conversation summary
  - âœ… Search for orchestrator topics
- Agent successfully loads conversations and provides relevant responses
