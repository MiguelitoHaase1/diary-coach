# Session 8 - Increment 0: Critical Test Fixes

## Objective
Fix critical integration tests before starting multi-agent implementation.

## Implementation Summary

### Test Failures Identified
1. **test_coach_node.py**: 4 failures related to conversation state management
2. **test_prompt_loader.py**: 1 failure due to outdated prompt expectations

### Root Causes
1. **Coach Node Tests**: DiaryCoach wasn't properly updating conversation_state to "morning" when:
   - It was morning time (6 AM - 11:59 AM)
   - User said "good morning"
   - Tests weren't mocking the time correctly

2. **Prompt Loader Test**: Expected old prompt structure ("Morning Ritual Protocol", "Evening Ritual Protocol") instead of new structure from Session 7 refactoring.

### Fixes Applied

#### 1. Coach Agent Logic Enhancement
- Modified `process_message` to:
  - Set conversation_state to "morning" when user says "morning" during morning hours
  - Extract challenge and value throughout the morning, not just on first message
  - Allow progressive capture of morning_challenge and morning_value

#### 2. Test Time Mocking
- Added proper datetime mocking using `unittest.mock.patch`
- Mocked current time to 8:00 AM for consistent morning behavior
- Applied to all affected tests

#### 3. Prompt Expectations Update
- Updated test assertions to match new prompt structure:
  - "Non-Directive Coaching Philosophy" (instead of "Morning Ritual Protocol")
  - "Problem Exploration Framework"
  - "Communication Constraints"

#### 4. Error Handling Test Fix
- Changed expectation from raising exception to returning error response
- DiaryCoach now catches exceptions and returns graceful error messages

## Results
- ✅ All 11 tests passing (5 coach_node + 6 prompt_loader)
- ✅ Coach properly manages conversation state
- ✅ Morning value extraction working correctly
- ✅ Prompt loader tests aligned with current prompt structure

## Code Quality
- All changes follow 88-character line limit
- No new linting issues introduced
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing interfaces

## Next Steps
- Proceed to Increment 1: Agent Interface Foundation
- No remaining blockers for multi-agent implementation
