# Log 8.11: Evaluation Experiments Implementation

## Session Details
- **Date**: 2025-07-22
- **Goal**: Implement proper LangSmith experiment tracking for both manual and automated evaluations

## Problem Statement

The evaluation system was sending metrics to LangSmith but not as proper experiments:
- Manual prototype runs: Sent as simple "eval" runs
- Automated tests: Only baseline eval script used experiments
- No unified approach for tracking coaching quality over time

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Evaluator Agent

Updated `src/agents/evaluator_agent.py` to send evaluations as experiments:

```python
# Create experiment run for manual prototype sessions
experiment_name = f"manual_coaching_session_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S')}"

# Create the experiment run
run_id = str(uuid4())
client.create_run(
    id=run_id,
    name=experiment_name,
    run_type="eval",
    inputs=example["inputs"],
    outputs={
        "response": conversation[-1]["content"] if conversation else "",
        "deep_thoughts": request.context.get("deep_thoughts", "")[:500]
    },
    extra={
        "experiment_metadata": {
            "experiment_name": experiment_name,
            "is_manual_session": True,
            "conversation_turns": len(conversation),
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        }
    }
)

# Add evaluation feedback as scores
for criterion_id, eval_data in evaluations.items():
    client.create_feedback(
        run_id=run_id,
        key=f"criterion_{criterion_id}",
        score=eval_data["score"],
        comment=eval_data["reasoning"]
    )
```

### 2. Automated Evaluation Script

Created `scripts/run_automated_eval_experiment.py` with:

- **Simulated User Class**: Uses LLM to generate realistic user responses
- **5 Test Scenarios**:
  - productivity_challenge: Overwhelmed professional
  - leadership_growth: New team lead with delegation issues
  - work_life_balance: Burnout from overwork
  - career_transition: Considering career change
  - team_conflict: Manager with team tensions

- **Full Integration**: Runs complete multi-agent sessions with:
  - Enhanced coach with agent collaboration
  - Memory agent for past context
  - Personal content agent for beliefs
  - Reporter agent for Deep Thoughts
  - Evaluator agent for quality assessment

### 3. Evaluation Flow

#### Manual Sessions:
1. User runs `python -m src.interface.multi_agent_cli`
2. Has conversation with coach
3. Types 'deep report' to generate evaluation
4. Evaluator automatically sends to LangSmith as experiment

#### Automated Sessions:
1. Run `python scripts/run_automated_eval_experiment.py`
2. LLM simulates 5 different user personas
3. Each has 4-6 turn conversation
4. Full evaluation pipeline runs
5. Results sent to LangSmith and saved locally

### 4. LangSmith Integration

Both manual and automated runs now:
- Create proper experiment runs
- Add individual criterion scores as feedback
- Track metadata (manual vs automated, timestamps, etc.)
- Enable comparison across sessions

## Technical Details

### Evaluation Criteria (5 metrics):
- **A**: Problem Definition (binary 0/1)
- **B**: Crux Recognition (binary 0/1)
- **C**: Today Accomplishment (binary 0/1)
- **D**: Multiple Paths (graduated 0.0-1.0)
- **E**: Core Beliefs (graduated 0.0-1.0)

### Overall Score Calculation:
- Binary criteria (A,B,C): 25% weight each
- Graduated criteria (D,E): 12.5% weight each

## Files Modified

1. `src/agents/evaluator_agent.py` - Added experiment tracking
2. `scripts/run_automated_eval_experiment.py` - New automated testing
3. `docs/evaluation_experiments.md` - New documentation

## Testing Results

Verified that:
- Manual CLI sessions send evaluations to LangSmith
- Automated script successfully simulates conversations
- All 5 criteria are properly scored
- Results appear in LangSmith dashboard
- Local JSON files capture full conversation details

## Next Steps

1. Run baseline evaluations to establish quality benchmarks
2. Set up CI/CD integration for automated testing
3. Create dashboards to track quality trends
4. Add more diverse test scenarios

## Key Learnings

1. **Experiment vs Run**: LangSmith experiments enable better comparison
2. **Feedback API**: Using create_feedback() properly attaches scores
3. **Simulated Users**: LLMs can effectively simulate realistic user personas
4. **Full Integration**: Important to test the complete multi-agent system
