# Session 8 - Increment 1: Agent Interface Foundation

## Objective
Establish clean agent abstraction that wraps LangGraph nodes with inter-agent communication.

## Implementation Summary

### Key Components Created

#### 1. MultiAgentState (`src/orchestration/multi_agent_state.py`)
Extended ConversationState with multi-agent capabilities:
- **Agent Messages**: Direct communication between agents
- **Pending Requests**: Track async agent requests
- **Agent Responses**: Store responses by agent
- **Stage Tracking**: Three-stage orchestration (Exploration, Orchestrated, Synthesis)
- **Active Agents**: Track which agents are currently active
- **Agent States**: Store internal state for each agent
- **Context Storage**: Dedicated storage for Memory, MCP, and Personal Content

Key methods:
- `add_agent_message()`: Send messages between agents
- `broadcast_message()`: Send to all active agents
- `complete_request()`: Complete pending requests
- `update_stage()`: Manage stage transitions
- `set_*_context()`: Store context from different agents

#### 2. MultiAgentCoachNode (`src/orchestration/multi_agent_coach_node.py`)
Enhanced coach node with multi-agent awareness:
- **Agent Need Analysis**: Automatically detects when other agents are needed
- **Request Generation**: Creates requests to Memory, MCP, or Personal Content agents
- **Stage Transition Logic**: Moves to Stage 2 when problem clarity is achieved
- **State Broadcasting**: Notifies other agents of important state changes

Agent detection patterns:
- Memory Agent: "remember when", "last time", "previously"
- MCP Agent: "todo", "task", "priority", "deadline"
- Personal Content: "values", "beliefs", "goals", "vision"

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
- **10 communication tests**: Message passing, broadcasting, state management
- **5 coach node tests**: Agent analysis, stage transitions, state tracking

### Design Decisions

1. **Inheritance Model**: MultiAgentState extends ConversationState to maintain backward compatibility
2. **Message Types**: Three types - request, response, broadcast
3. **Stage Transitions**: Automatic based on problem clarity and conversation depth
4. **Agent Activation**: Explicit activation/deactivation for resource management

### Test Results
- âœ… All 10 inter-agent communication tests passing
- âœ… All 5 multi-agent coach node tests passing
- âœ… All 13 existing agent tests still passing
- âœ… All 5 original coach node tests still passing
- âœ… Complete backward compatibility maintained

## Code Quality
- All new code follows 88-character line limit
- Comprehensive docstrings for all classes and methods
- Type hints throughout
- No linting issues

## Next Steps
Ready for Increment 2: Memory Agent Implementation
- Will use the agent communication channels established here
- Can send/receive messages through MultiAgentState
- Coach already prepared to request memory context

## Human Tasks
ðŸ”´ **HUMAN TESTING REQUIRED**:
- [ ] Test basic coach interaction to ensure nothing is broken
- [ ] Try a conversation with "remember when" to see agent detection
- [ ] Verify the coach still responds naturally without delays
