# Session 8 - Increment 4: MCP Agent - Todoist Only

## Objective
Clean abstraction over Todoist MCP server (building on Session 6 lessons).

## Implementation Summary

### Key Components Created

#### 1. MCPAgent (`src/agents/mcp_agent.py`)
A dedicated agent that wraps the existing MCPTodoNode from Session 6:

**Core Features**:
- Reuses MCPTodoNode for all MCP communication
- Provides structured responses for LangGraph integration
- Handles connection status queries
- Supports date filters (today, overdue)
- Intelligent task filtering based on conversation context
- Graceful error handling when MCP server unavailable
- Limits display to top 5 most relevant tasks

**Response Format**:
```
CURRENT TASKS:
- [High Priority] Task content (Project: Name, Due: Date)
- [Medium Priority] Task content (Project: Name)
- Task content (no special markers for low priority)

TASK SUMMARY:
Total: X tasks | High Priority: Y | Due Today: Z
```

**Design Decisions**:
1. **Reuse Session 6 Infrastructure**: Leverages existing MCPTodoNode completely
2. **Todoist Focus**: Single MCP server integration as specified
3. **Structured Output**: Consistent with other agents for seamless communication
4. **Smart Filtering**: Uses conversation context for relevance
5. **Error Isolation**: MCP failures don't crash the coaching flow

#### 2. MCP Agent Prompt
Created `src/agents/prompts/mcp_agent_prompt.md` defining:
- Agent's role in task management
- Todoist-specific capabilities
- Response structure for clarity
- Error handling guidelines
- Security (never expose API tokens)

#### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite
Created 10 unit tests covering:
- Successful and failed initialization
- Connection status queries
- Today and overdue task filters
- Relevant task filtering
- Task formatting with priorities
- Error handling
- Empty response handling
- Task limit enforcement (max 5)

#### 4. Integration Tests
Created 5 integration tests verifying:
- Multi-agent state integration
- Coach â†’ MCP Agent communication
- Context relevance filtering
- Connection failure handling
- Stage-based agent activation

### Legacy Code Handling

Following CLAUDE.md's Fourth Law (Clean Architecture Transitions):
- âœ… Kept MCPTodoNode intact - it's still actively used
- âœ… Created new agent wrapper instead of modifying existing code
- âœ… Old test_mcp_todo_integration.py still valid for MCPTodoNode
- âœ… Added new integration tests for agent architecture

### Test Results
- âœ… All 10 MCP Agent tests passing
- âœ… All 5 integration tests passing
- âœ… All 43 agent tests passing (system-wide)
- âœ… No linting issues

### MCP Best Practices Applied
From docs/MCP_howto.md:
1. **Real Servers Only**: Uses actual MCP server via MCPTodoNode
2. **Research First**: Reused existing Doist MCP implementation
3. **Read, Then Code**: Leveraged Session 6's proven fixes
4. **Architecture First**: Clear data flow through agent interface
5. **Observability**: Connection status endpoint included

## Code Quality
- Comprehensive error handling
- Type hints throughout
- Clear docstrings
- 88-character line limit maintained

## Next Steps
Ready for Increment 5: Coach Agent Enhancement
- Enable coach to autonomously call other agents
- Implement decision logic for when to call agents
- Maintain conversation flow during agent calls

## Human Tasks
ðŸ”´ **HUMAN SETUP REQUIRED**:
- [x] Verified all agent tests passing
- [ ] Start MCP server and verify connection
- [ ] Find out where the prompt for this agent is - and improve it
- [ ] Test "what should I work on today?" - verify Todoist tasks appear
- [ ] Turn off MCP server and verify graceful degradation
- [ ] **DECISION POINT**: Continue to 8b or complete in one session?
