# Session 8: Test Status Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks which tests to fix with each increment of Session 8 implementation.

## Testing Philosophy
**Test continuously**: Every increment includes both AI-run automated tests and human manual testing. Fix issues immediately as they occur.

## Current Status (Post Session 8.0)
- ✅ **Agent Tests**: 13/13 passing
- 📊 **Total**: 206 passing, 16 failing (was 201/21)

## Test Fixing Schedule

### Increment 0: Critical Fixes (Before multi-agent work) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] `test_coach_node.py` (4 tests) - Update for BaseAgent inheritance
- [x] `test_prompt_loader.py` (1 test) - Fix prompt loading expectations

### Increment 1: Agent Interface Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created 10 inter-agent communication tests
- [x] Created 5 multi-agent coach node tests
- [x] All existing tests still passing

### Increment 2: Memory Agent ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created 10 new Memory Agent tests
- [x] Created 4 integration tests
- [x] Old memory recall tests now obsolete (different architecture)

### Increment 3: Personal Content Agent
- [ ] `test_implicit_context_injection.py` (1 test) - Update for agent architecture

### Increment 4: MCP Agent
- [ ] `test_mcp_todo_integration.py` (3 tests) - Update for MCP Agent interface

### Increment 5: Coach Agent Enhancement
- No new test fixes (enhancing existing functionality)

### Increment 6: Orchestrator Agent
- [ ] `test_integration/test_session_1_e2e.py` (2 tests) - Update orchestration

### Increment 7: Reporter & Evaluator
- [ ] `test_personas.py` (1 test) - Update for 5-criteria system
- [ ] `test_persona_evaluator.py` (3 tests) - Rewrite for Evaluator Agent
- [ ] `test_session_2_e2e.py` (3 tests) - Full integration rewrite

## Deferred Tests
These will be addressed after Session 8 or in follow-up sessions:
- `test_otel_tracing.py` (1 test) - OpenTelemetry tracing
- Various old integration tests that assume single-agent architecture

## Success Metrics
- Increment 0: 5 tests fixed → 206/222 passing
- Full Session 8: All agent-related tests passing
- Target: 95%+ test coverage for multi-agent system

## Testing Checkpoint Template
For each increment:
1. 🤖 AI runs automated tests specified in plan
2. 🔴 Human performs manual tests specified in plan
3. 🟡 Both review any failures together
4. ✅ Fix issues before moving to next increment
5. 📝 Update this tracker with results
