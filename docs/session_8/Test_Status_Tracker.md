# Session 8: Test Status Tracker

## Overview
This document tracks which tests to fix with each increment of Session 8 implementation.

## Testing Philosophy
**Test continuously**: Every increment includes both AI-run automated tests and human manual testing. Fix issues immediately as they occur.

⚠️ **Session 8.9 Learning**: Tests marked as "fixed" in earlier increments were still failing. Must verify test status after each increment completion.

## Current Status (Post Session 8.9)
- ✅ **Agent Tests**: 13/13 passing
- ✅ **Coach Tests**: 7/7 passing (fixed in 8.9)
- ✅ **Multi-Agent Tests**: 20/20 passing (fixed in 8.9)
- ✅ **MCP Tests**: 15/15 passing (fixed in 8.9)
- 📊 **Total**: 211 passing, 50 failing, 8 errors (78% pass rate, up from 74%)

## Test Fixing Schedule

### Increment 0: Critical Fixes (Before multi-agent work) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] `test_coach_node.py` (4 tests) - Update for BaseAgent inheritance
- [x] `test_prompt_loader.py` (1 test) - Fix prompt loading expectations

### Increment 1: Agent Interface Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created 10 inter-agent communication tests
- [x] Created 5 multi-agent coach node tests
- [x] All existing tests still passing

### Increment 2: Memory Agent ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Created 10 new Memory Agent tests
- [x] Created 4 integration tests
- [x] Old memory recall tests now obsolete (different architecture)

### Increment 3: Personal Content Agent
- [ ] `test_implicit_context_injection.py` (1 test) - Update for agent architecture

### Increment 4: MCP Agent ✅ COMPLETED IN SESSION 8.9
- [x] `test_mcp_todo_integration.py` (5 tests) - Updated for MCP Agent interface
- [x] `test_mcp_agent.py` (10 tests) - Fixed task formatting expectations

### Increment 5: Coach Agent Enhancement ✅ VERIFIED IN SESSION 8.9
- [x] All coach agent tests passing after context parameter fixes
- [x] Enhanced coach agent tests (12 tests) all passing

### Increment 6: Orchestrator Agent
- [ ] `test_integration/test_session_1_e2e.py` (2 tests) - Update orchestration

### Increment 7: Reporter & Evaluator
- [ ] `test_personas.py` (1 test) - Update for 5-criteria system
- [ ] `test_persona_evaluator.py` (3 tests) - Rewrite for Evaluator Agent
- [ ] `test_session_2_e2e.py` (3 tests) - Full integration rewrite

## Deferred Tests
These will be addressed after Session 8 or in follow-up sessions:
- `test_otel_tracing.py` (1 test) - OpenTelemetry tracing
- Various old integration tests that assume single-agent architecture

## Success Metrics
- Increment 0: 5 tests fixed → 206/222 passing
- Session 8.9: 30+ tests fixed → 211/269 passing (78%, up from 74%)
- Full Session 8: All agent-related tests passing
- Target: 95%+ test coverage for multi-agent system

## Session 8.9 Test Fix Summary
Fixed all tests that should have been passing from Increments 0-5:
- **Coach Agent Tests**: Fixed AgentRequest context parameter (7 tests)
- **Enhanced Coach Tests**: Already passing (12 tests)
- **Multi-Agent E2E Tests**: Fixed async fixtures and mocks (8 tests)
- **MCP Agent Tests**: Fixed task formatting expectations (10 tests)
- **MCP Integration Tests**: Fixed mocking and assertions (5 tests)
- **Total Fixed**: 30+ tests across 6 test files

## Testing Checkpoint Template
For each increment:
1. 🤖 AI runs automated tests specified in plan
2. 🔴 Human performs manual tests specified in plan
3. 🟡 Both review any failures together
4. ✅ Fix issues before moving to next increment
5. 📝 Update this tracker with results
6. ⚠️ VERIFY all claimed fixes are actually passing!
