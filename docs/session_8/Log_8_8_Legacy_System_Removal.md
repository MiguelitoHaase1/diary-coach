# Session 8.8: Legacy System Removal & Test Optimization

**Date**: July 19, 2025
**Duration**: ~60 minutes
**Approach**: Remove duplicate single-agent system and optimize slow test suite

## Objectives
1. Remove legacy single-agent system (src/main.py and related files)
2. Consolidate to multi-agent architecture with configurable modes
3. Fix slow test suite that was timing out

## Key Decisions
- Keep multi-agent system as the sole implementation
- Use environment variable (DISABLE_MULTI_AGENT) for single-agent mode
- Separate fast and slow tests with pytest markers

## Actions Taken

### 1. Removed Legacy Single-Agent System
- Deleted `src/main.py` (legacy entry point)
- Deleted `src/interface/cli.py` (base CLI class)
- Deleted `src/interface/enhanced_cli.py` (evaluation CLI)
- Deleted associated test files

### 2. Fixed MultiAgentCLI Bugs
- Fixed undefined 'coach' variable in agent registration
- Changed `coach` to `self.coach` in two places

### 3. Made MultiAgentCLI Self-Contained
- Moved evaluation capabilities from EnhancedCLI into MultiAgentCLI
- Added all necessary imports and methods
- Fixed inheritance issues

### 4. Updated Failing Tests
- Updated imports from old CLIs to MultiAgentCLI
- Fixed mock setup to use AsyncMock for async methods
- Updated test expectations (agent_name, prompt text)
- Created simplified test file for complex tests

### 5. Optimized Test Suite
- Created `pytest.ini` with test markers and default exclusions
- Added smoke test suite that runs in <1 second
- Properly mocked expensive operations (evaluations, API calls)

## Technical Details

### Architecture Changes
- **Before**: Two parallel systems (single-agent and multi-agent)
- **After**: One system with configurable behavior
- **Entry Point**: `run_multi_agent.py` for all use cases

### Test Performance
- **Problem**: Tests were timing out due to:
  - Real API calls to Anthropic and LangSmith
  - Heavy evaluation logic running during tests
  - No separation between unit and integration tests
- **Solution**: 
  - Added pytest markers (unit, integration, slow, smoke)
  - Mocked all external dependencies in smoke tests
  - Default pytest runs only fast tests

### Code Impact
- **Removed**: 1034 lines
- **Added**: 413 lines
- **Net Reduction**: 621 lines

## Learning Opportunities

### For Michael
- Consider test performance from the start
- Separate unit and integration tests early
- Mock expensive operations by default
- Use environment variables for feature toggles

### For Assistant
- Always check for variable scope issues (coach vs self.coach)
- Consider test execution time when writing tests
- Properly mock async operations with AsyncMock
- Update all dependent tests when changing APIs

## Next Steps
1. Monitor test suite performance over time
2. Consider adding more smoke tests for critical paths
3. Document the single vs multi-agent mode differences
4. Add CI/CD configuration to run appropriate test suites
