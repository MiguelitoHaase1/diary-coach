# Session 8 Increment 6: Orchestrator Agent & Stage Transitions

## Duration
~45 minutes

## Objective
Implement the Orchestrator Agent to coordinate multi-agent collaboration after problem identification and enable stage transitions from Stage 1 to Stage 2.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Created Orchestrator Agent Implementation
- **File**: `src/agents/orchestrator_agent.py`
- **Capabilities**: 
  - AGENT_COORDINATION: Coordinates multiple agents
  - PARALLEL_EXECUTION: Runs agent queries in parallel
  - STAGE_MANAGEMENT: Manages stage transitions
- **Key Methods**:
  - `_check_stage_transition()`: Evaluates if conversation should move to Stage 2
  - `_coordinate_stage2_agents()`: Orchestrates parallel agent queries
  - `_query_agent_with_timeout()`: Prevents blocking with timeouts

### 2. Stage Transition Logic
**Transition Triggers**:
- User has articulated a clear problem/challenge
- Conversation has reached sufficient depth (3+ exchanges)
- Coach explicitly requests orchestration

**Problem Detection**:
- Keywords: "challenge", "problem", "struggle", "overwhelmed", etc.
- Requires specific problem description (>10 words)
- Activates Stage 2 when problem is identified

### 3. Enhanced Coach Integration
**Updates to `enhanced_coach_agent.py`**:
- Added stage management properties
- Integrated `_check_stage_transition()` calls
- Added `_gather_stage2_context()` for orchestrated gathering
- Updated metadata to track current stage

### 4. Multi-Agent CLI Updates
**Updates to `multi_agent_cli.py`**:
- Imported and initialized OrchestratorAgent
- Registered orchestrator in agent registry
- Updated UI to show stage information
- Added stage tracking in agent consultation display

### 5. Added Missing Agent Capabilities
**Updates to `src/agents/base.py`**:
- Added AGENT_COORDINATION capability
- Added PARALLEL_EXECUTION capability  
- Added STAGE_MANAGEMENT capability

### 6. Comprehensive Test Suite
**File**: `tests/agents/test_orchestrator_agent.py`
- 8 tests covering all orchestrator functionality
- Tests for stage transitions with various triggers
- Tests for parallel agent coordination
- Tests for timeout handling
- All tests passing âœ…

## Technical Details

### Stage Flow
1. **Stage 1**: Coach leads with selective agent calls (max 2 per turn)
2. **Transition Check**: After each message, check if problem identified
3. **Stage 2**: Orchestrator coordinates all agents in parallel
4. **Stage 3**: (Future) Deep Thoughts synthesis

### Parallel Execution
- Uses `asyncio.gather()` for concurrent agent queries
- 5-second timeout per agent to prevent blocking
- Graceful error handling for failed agents
- Aggregates all responses into unified context

### Code Quality
- All files pass flake8 linting
- 88-character line limit maintained
- Proper async/await patterns
- Comprehensive error handling

## Lessons Learned

1. **Fixture Setup**: Async fixtures need careful handling in pytest
2. **Agent Response API**: Must match exact dataclass fields
3. **Stage Management**: Clear triggers prevent premature transitions
4. **Parallel Execution**: Timeouts essential for reliability

## Next Steps

- Increment 7: Reporter & Evaluator Integration
- Test orchestrator with real multi-agent conversations
- Fine-tune stage transition triggers based on usage
- Add metrics for orchestration performance
