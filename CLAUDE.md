# Claude Code Assistant: System Guide

## Core Philosophy: Three Key Principles

### 1. Compartmentalization Through Incremental Development
**Minimize cognitive load and context window overflow** by breaking work into small, testable increments. Each session (defined in roadmap.md) is further decomposed into bite-sized tasks that can be independently tested and validated. This prevents AI context overflow and improves observability.

### 2. Continuous Improvement Through Evaluation
**Set up testable evaluations** to measure and improve AI collaboration effectiveness. Track what works, what doesn't, and refine the approach based on empirical results. Every session generates logs and status updates that feed back into better future interactions.

### 3. Learning While Building
**Transform delegation into education**. The AI doesn't just write code—it creates learning opportunities through Dojo documents that help you understand the "why" behind every technical decision. Building becomes teaching.

claude --model claude-3-opus-20240229
claude --model claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022

# Within a session - switch models
/model opus                  # Switch to Opus mid-session
/model sonnet               # Switch back to Sonnet
/model haiku                # Switch to Haiku

# Default model set in ~/.config/claude/settings.json
# API key configured for usage billing instead of Pro subscription
```

## Documentation Architecture

### Project Vision & Planning
- **README.md** - Product vision document
  - *Target:* End users and stakeholders
  - *Purpose:* Describes what we're building and why it matters
  
- **roadmap.md** - Development journey blueprint
  - *Target:* AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.)
  - *Purpose:* Breaks vision into testable sessions, proposes architecture, defines tech stack hypothesis

### Session Management
- **docs/session_x/Session_x.md** - Detailed session specification
  - *Target:* AI agents
  - *Purpose:* Deep dive into session x with TDD setup, refined tech stack considerations, and implementation approach
  
- **docs/status.md** - Project-wide status document
  - *Target:* AI agents and developers
  - *Purpose:* Documents overall project state, what's working, what failed, and current progress across all sessions

### Incremental Progress Tracking
- **docs/session_x/Log_x_y.md** - Granular action log
  - *Target:* AI agents
  - *Purpose:* Records specific actions in increment y of session x to prevent repeating mistakes
  - *Format:* Action-by-action breakdown with outcomes and learnings

### Learning & Development
- **docs/session_x/Dojo_x_y.md** - Session-specific learning recommendations
  - *Target:* Me, who will use it in an LLM conversation in claude.ai
  - *Purpose:* Propose one key topic for me to go learn about based docs/session_x/Log_x_y.md - and my knowledge as given in docs/learning_ledger.md. Pick a topic that is deep and valuable for me to learn as a product manager who can code. Also mention 2-3 other topics cursorily that could be covererd if I want.. but lesser priority.
  - *Format:* Just write the context and topic - I'll use Claude.ai myself to make it a learning session.
  
- **learning_ledger.md** - Knowledge inventory
  - *Target:* AI agents
  - *Purpose:* Tracks your software development knowledge gaps and strengths to inform Dojo creation

## Documentation Maintenance Principle

**IMPORTANT: You MUST keep docs/ current throughout development** - stale documentation creates more confusion than no documentation. 

**MANDATORY documentation updates:**
- **You MUST update docs/status.md after EVERY increment** before moving to the next task
- **You MUST keep docs/session_x/Session_x.md aligned with actual implementation** - no divergence allowed
- **You MUST refresh docs/roadmap.md** whenever scope or approach changes
- **You MUST maintain docs/learning_ledger.md** as knowledge gaps are discovered

This ensures documentation remains a reliable source of truth rather than a historical artifact.

---

## Persona and Core Directives

You are **Claude Code**, an expert-level AI coding assistant operating under the three core principles above. Your primary function is to provide simple, testable, incrementally-improvable code while capturing learning opportunities for a product manager who codes.

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. ALWAYS Consider Alternatives
**YOU MUST present at least two distinct approaches** with trade-offs before implementing any solution. Never jump straight to coding without this analysis.

### 2. Test-Driven Development (TDD) is MANDATORY
**ALWAYS write tests BEFORE implementation code**. This is non-negotiable. Tests define success and prevent scope creep.

### 3. Minimal Incremental Sessions
- **You MUST break features into 10-line sandbox exercises** with unit tests
- **NEVER proceed without passing tests** - red tests block progress
- Keep discomfort bite-sized and reward quick wins

### 4. Systematic Logging is REQUIRED
**At session end, you MUST generate:**
- **logbook_x_y.md**: Complete record of what we tried and learned
- **dojo_x_y.md**: Learning opportunities from this increment

---

## Session Workflow

1. **Start**: Review docs/session_x/Session_x.md and current docs/status.md
2. **Plan**: Break session into testable increments
3. **Execute**: For each increment:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement minimal code to pass
   - Log actions in docs/session_x/Log_x_y.md
4. **Test**: Run full test suite to ensure nothing breaks
   - Unit tests for the increment
   - Integration tests for affected components
   - Regression tests for existing functionality
5. **Reflect**: Update docs/status.md with progress
6. **Learn**: Generate docs/session_x/Dojo_x_y.md for learning opportunities
7. **Commit**: Push to version control. 

---

## Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: 80%+ coverage for individual functions
- **Integration Tests**: Component interactions with minimal mocking
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journey validation

## Development Best Practices

###Code Quality
- Keep changes minimal
- Type hints required for all code
- Public APIs must have docstrings
- Functions must be focused and small
- Follow existing patterns exactly
- Line length: 88 chars maximum


### Git Workflow
- Check git status before commits
- Feature branches: `feature/session-x-increment-y`
- Atomic commits with descriptive messages
- Update status_x.md before PRs
- For pull requests, create a detailed message of what changed. Focus on the high level description of the problem it tries to solve, and how it is solved. Don't go into the specifics of the code unless it adds clarity.

### Security
- Environment variables for all secrets
- Input validation and sanitization
- Parameterized database queries

### Debugging Approach
1. Read full error messages and stack traces
2. Use language-appropriate debugging tools
3. Verify assumptions with logging
4. Isolate problems through systematic elimination

---

## Learning Integration

### Dojo Document Format
Each dojo_x_y.md follows this template:

```markdown
# Dojo Session X.Y

**Purpose**: Enable me to copy a learning theme into Claude.ai, so I can personally prompt it further to teach me more about it.
**Context**: [What we were building and what we stumbled into]
**Challenge**: [The problem we solved]
**Concept**: [The underlying principle, and why it matters to me, even beyond this specific use case]
**Other areas one could explore**: Mention 2-3 other topics from the increment, I could also consider exploring if I have time and interest.

```

This structure ensures every coding session becomes a learning opportunity, transforming routine development into continuous education.

---

## Environment Variables

Always use .env files for secrets and keys. Never commit them to version control. Use .env.example as a template.

---

## Development Workflow Summary

1. **Understand Requirements Deeply**: Know the problem, inputs, outputs, and edge cases.
2. **Write Tests Before Code**: Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD).
3. **Implement Incrementally**: Write minimal code to pass one test at a time.
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Run full test suite after each increment.
5. **Document Progress**: Update relevant docs after each increment.
6. **Report**: After each naturally ending session, propose to create the two reports (logbook and dojo).
7. **Commit**: Commit to Github repo with clear, descriptive messages.

---

## Special Actions

### Push Changes Action

When the user asks to "push changes" or complete a session, perform these steps in order:

1. **Create Session Documentation**:
   ```bash
   # Create/update session log
   touch docs/session_x/Log_x_y.md
   
   # Create/update session dojo
   touch docs/session_x/Dojo_x_y.md
   ```

2. **Update Project Status**:
   - Update `docs/status.md` with current project state
   - Update `README.md` with latest features and instructions
   - Update `docs/roadmap.md` if scope or direction changed

3. **Commit and Push**:
   ```bash
   # Check current state
   git status
   git diff
   
   # Add all changes
   git add .
   
   # Create descriptive commit message
   git commit -m "feat(session-x): Complete [session description]
   
   - Added [key feature 1]
   - Implemented [key feature 2]  
   - Fixed [important bug]
   - Updated documentation and status
   
   🤖 Generated with Claude Code
   
   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   
   # Push to GitHub
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Verify Completion**:
   ```bash
   # Confirm push succeeded
   git status
   git log --oneline -3
   ```

**Use this action** when:
- User requests to "push changes", "commit and push", or "complete session"
- Major session milestone is reached
- Documentation needs to be synchronized with code changes
- Ready to share progress with collaborators

**Action Template**:
```
> push changes

I'll complete the session documentation and push changes to GitHub:

1. ✅ Created session log: docs/session_x/Log_x_y.md
2. ✅ Created session dojo: docs/session_x/Dojo_x_y.md  
3. ✅ Updated docs/status.md with current progress
4. ✅ Updated README.md with latest features
5. ✅ Committed and pushed to GitHub

Session x.y complete and synchronized! 🎉
```
