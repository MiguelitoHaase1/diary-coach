- **Observability**: Tracing and debugging workflows

## Architecture Patterns

### 1. Multi-Agent Coaching System
```python
# Example structure for diary coach
graph = StateGraph(CoachingState)

# Add nodes for each agent
graph.add_node("orchestrator", orchestrator_agent)
graph.add_node("coach", coach_agent)
graph.add_node("memory", memory_agent)
graph.add_node("mcp", mcp_agent)

# Define routing logic
graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "orchestrator",
    route_to_agent,
    {
        "coach": "coach",
        "memory": "memory", 
        "mcp": "mcp",
        "end": END
    }
)
```

### 2. State Management
```python
class CoachingState(TypedDict):
    messages: List[BaseMessage]
    agent_outputs: Dict[str, Any]
    context: Dict[str, Any]
    next_agent: Optional[str]
    iteration: int
```

### 3. Conditional Routing
```python
def route_to_agent(state: CoachingState) -> str:
    # Intelligent routing based on conversation needs
    if needs_memory_context(state):
        return "memory"
    elif needs_external_data(state):
        return "mcp"
    elif reached_conclusion(state):
        return "end"
    return "coach"
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Graph Design Principles
- Start with simple linear flows
- Add complexity incrementally
- Use subgraphs for reusable patterns
- Keep state minimal and focused
- Document decision points clearly

### 2. Performance Optimization
- Parallel execution where possible
- Lazy loading of agent resources
- Efficient state serialization
- Streaming for better UX
- Caching of expensive operations

### 3. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual nodes
- Integration tests for graph flows
- Property-based testing for state transitions
- Load testing for concurrent execution
- Chaos testing for error paths

### 4. Debugging Techniques
- Enable LangSmith tracing
- Add logging at decision points
- Visualize graph execution
- Track state evolution
- Monitor token usage

## Common Patterns

### 1. Supervisor Pattern
```python
# Central coordinator manages other agents
supervisor → analyze_request → route_to_specialist → aggregate_results
```

### 2. Pipeline Pattern
```python
# Sequential processing with transformations
input → preprocess → analyze → enhance → format → output
```

### 3. MapReduce Pattern
```python
# Parallel processing with aggregation
input → split → map(process) → reduce(combine) → output
```

### 4. Retry with Refinement
```python
# Iterative improvement based on feedback
attempt → evaluate → refine_if_needed → retry_or_complete
```

## Migration Strategy (from existing system)

### 1. Assessment Phase
- Map current agent interactions
- Identify state requirements
- Document decision points
- Plan incremental migration

### 2. Implementation Phase
- Create state schema
- Implement one agent at a time
- Add routing logic
- Test each addition thoroughly

### 3. Optimization Phase
- Add parallelization
- Implement caching
- Add checkpointing
- Enable streaming

## Best Practices

1. **State Design**: Keep state flat and serializable
2. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation at each node
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and tracing
4. **Testing**: Test individual nodes and full graphs
5. **Documentation**: Clear flow diagrams and decision logic

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-engineering**: Start simple, add complexity as needed
2. **State Bloat**: Don't store everything in state
3. **Tight Coupling**: Keep nodes independent
4. **Missing Error Paths**: Plan for failures
5. **Poor Observability**: Can't debug what you can't see

## Success Metrics
- Graph execution time: <2s for simple flows
- State serialization: <100KB per checkpoint
- Error recovery: Graceful handling of all failures
- Observability: Full trace of every execution
- Modularity: Nodes reusable across graphs

## Advanced Features

### 1. Dynamic Graph Construction
- Build graphs based on user requirements
- Add/remove nodes at runtime
- Conditional subgraph inclusion

### 2. Multi-Modal Workflows
- Handle text, voice, and visual inputs
- Route based on modality
- Merge multi-modal outputs

### 3. Human-in-the-Loop
- Approval gates for sensitive operations
- Manual override capabilities
- Feedback incorporation

## Evaluation System Integration

### Key Learnings from Production

Based on Sessions 3-7 of the Diary Coach project, here are critical evaluation patterns:

### ❌ What NOT to Do

1. **Don't Mock External Services**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Creating mock Run objects
mock_run = Run(id=str(uuid.uuid4()), ...)
# Why it fails: Bypasses LangSmith's tracking infrastructure
```

2. **Don't Use Hardcoded Scores**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Fixed evaluation scores
behavioral_scores = [
    AnalysisScore("SpecificityPush", 0.6, "Mock reasoning")
]
# Why it fails: Creates false confidence, hides real issues
```

3. **Don't Evaluate Single Messages**
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Analyzing one response in isolation
score = await analyzer.analyze(coach_response, context)
# Why it fails: Misses conversation flow and progression
```

### ✅ What TO Do

1. **Use LangSmith's Evaluation Framework Properly**
```python
# ✅ RIGHT: Use aevaluate with proper dataset
from langsmith.evaluation import aevaluate

results = await aevaluate(
    target_function,
    data=dataset_name,
    evaluators=langsmith_evaluators,
    experiment_prefix="coaching_eval",
    client=langsmith_client
)
```

2. **Create Robust JSON Parsing for LLM Outputs**
```python
# ✅ RIGHT: Handle markdown and control characters
def parse_llm_json(result: str) -> dict:
    json_str = result.strip()
    
    # Handle markdown code blocks
    if "```json" in json_str:
        json_str = json_str.split("```json")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
    elif "```" in json_str:
        json_str = json_str.split("```")[1].split("```")[0].strip()
    
    try:
        return json.loads(json_str)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Regex fallback for embedded JSON
        import re
        json_match = re.search(r'\{[^{}]*(?:\{[^{}]*\}[^{}]*)*\}', result, re.DOTALL)
        if json_match:
            json_text = json_match.group()
            json_text = json_text.replace('\n', ' ').replace('\r', ' ')
            return json.loads(json_text)
        raise
```

3. **Evaluate Full Conversations**
```python
# ✅ RIGHT: Analyze entire conversation with context
conversation_history = self._format_conversation_history(conversation)
eval_prompt = f"""
## Conversation Context
{conversation_history}

## Deep Report Context  
{coach_response}

Evaluate the ENTIRE conversation...
"""
```

### Evaluation Criteria Design

Focus on 5 key criteria instead of many:
```python
EVALUATOR_REGISTRY = {
    "problem_definition": ProblemDefinitionEvaluator,      # A
    "crux_recognition": CruxRecognitionEvaluator,         # B
    "today_accomplishment": TodayAccomplishmentEvaluator, # C
    "multiple_paths": MultiplePathsEvaluator,             # D
    "core_beliefs": CoreBeliefsEvaluator,                 # E
}
```

### Integration with LangGraph

When building evaluation workflows in LangGraph:

1. **Create Evaluation Nodes**
```python
# Add evaluation as a node in your graph
graph.add_node("evaluate", evaluation_agent)
graph.add_edge("coach", "evaluate")  # Evaluate after coaching
```

2. **Use Conditional Routing for Evaluation**
```python
def should_evaluate(state: State) -> str:
    # Evaluate after significant conversations
    if state["turn_count"] > 5 or state["breakthrough_detected"]:
        return "evaluate"
    return "continue"
```

3. **Stream Evaluation Results**
```python
# Stream partial evaluation results as they complete
async for chunk in graph.astream(state):
    if "evaluate" in chunk:
        yield chunk["evaluate"]["criteria_scores"]
```

## Remember
- LangGraph is about orchestration, not just chaining
- State management is crucial - design it carefully
- Observability is your best friend for debugging
- Start simple, iterate based on real usage
- Performance matters - measure and optimize
- **For evaluations**: Never mock external services, always evaluate full conversations, and use robust JSON parsing for LLM outputs
